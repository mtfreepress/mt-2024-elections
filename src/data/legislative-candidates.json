I look forward to our recommendations and my role in potentially sponsoring bills to mitigate excessively high taxes in many areas of Montana.\nSpecifically, about 20% of the residential property tax portfolio is comprised of out of state owners who are likely part time residents. Perhaps we need to bifurcate the residency category or consider a higher rate for residential taxable values but at the same time offer discounted appraisal values for full time residents. We have about 15 active tax categories, so we need to avoid substantial tax shifts as we address the inequities.\n"

I think all forms of Medicaid need to be available to eligible Montana's. Last session the legislature fully funded the medicaid reimbursement rate for providers, If the rate falls behind as has been occurring, providers cannot afford to stay in business. We must stay up to date by addressing funding needs every.\n session. In 2025 Medicaid Expansion is up for reauthorization. A very high percentage of participants are low wage working Montanan's who's access to health care is dependent on the program. Expansion keeps our very rural hospitals afloat."

          "answer": "First and foremost is the need to fix residential property taxes, so especially the middle class can afford potential increases that may occur with any substantial boost to K-12 funding. There is currently funding that addresses per/student increases up to 3% per year. To address the higher inflation rates of the near past and look at overall boost of the career earning potential of an educator, the state should be willing to provide budget authority to districts to increases through the next biennium budget of a minimum of 5%/year and provide additional state funding for the middle portion of the funding formula known as Guaranteed Tax Base. We must be aware of unfunded liabilities for pensions and study district consolidations."

          "answer": "Property Tax Relief – A rapid increase in residential property values combined with cuts in the state income tax has disproportionately shifted an increasing amount of the tax burden onto home owners. It is a travesty that so many Montana citizens are struggling to pay these significant increases while the property taxes paid by Governor Gianforte on his Helena mansion actually went down! See suggestions to remedy this situation below in answers to question 3. Other issues: expand Medicaid (it is good for the economy and good for our people), keep public lands in public hands (let the Feds pay for firefighting while we enjoy the forests), mitigate climate change (creating new technology jobs to power a clean future)."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "What is needed is a more equitable system of taxation. One solution would be to raise the property tax rate and then provide a \"homestead tax credit\" to Montanans on their primary residence. The effect will be to shift the burden onto wealthier Montanans with second homes and onto out-of-state residents with vacation homes in Montana. There is some justice in this , since the rapid increase in property values has been caused in part by non-residents buying up property & thereby raising housing costs for locals. To raise more revenue, recent income tax cuts will need to be reversed. We could consider a sales tax; however, a sales tax is regressive falling most heavily on those least able to afford it. Better to institute a luxury tax ."

          "answer": "1. Medicaid needs to be expanded. Medicaid is paid primarily by the Federal government and even generates a 27 million dollar surplus. 2. Six million dollars of the Cannabis tax goes to the HEART account for addiction treatment. As this revenue increases, instead of a fixed dollar amount, HEART should receive a percentage of the revenue. 3. In 2022, over 100,000 Americans died of an overdose. States sued opioid distributors and won. Montana currently has 2.4 million in its opioid settlement fund. More money will be coming in over the next 20 years. So far, none of this money has been spent. It should be utilized as a plentiful source of funding for health care, especially for drug addiction treatment programs."

          "answer": "The state needs to raise additional tax revenue and earmark this for education (see question 3 above). The state must utilize every federal dollar available in the Head Start and Early Head Start programs to pay for pre-k education. These programs yield improved long-term outcomes for children in otherwise disadvantaged economic conditions. Plus, they essentially provide free child care allowing the parent to enter the work force and become a more productive tax paying citizen. Vocational programs should be available in high school and after graduation. These programs produce tradespeople who make good wages and pay more taxes. Voucher programs and charter schools are NOT the solution. They drain funds from the public school system. "

          "answer": "Current Montana law states that any parcel of 160 acres or more automatically qualifies for an agriculture rate, which is a significantly reduced property tax rate. However, in recent years not all such land parcels are used for agriculture purposes and I would support legislation that charges them a higher rate, such as a recreation rate (although that is not a current rate classification in Montana).

I would support a system that assists with a college education if upon graduation and with professional certification the student spent 3-5 years practicing in a rural Montana location. Rural Montanans may also face the obstacle of transportation to a medical facility. Anything we can do to improve access to a public transportation system is beneficial."

I went to work for Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. in June, 1996 in Managerial positions in Montana and retired on January 2, 2024. I graduated from Dawson County High School with the class of 1976! I have seen and experienced many sides of life, good, bad, indifferent, I have spent many years watching MT thrive and then many years not so much. I have been testifying at hearings in the MT Legislature since 2003 in order to make it easier to produce our Natural Resources and to fight against the radical Environmentalists."

I will bring a 4% State Wide Sales Tax, we will get rid of State Income Tax, we will get rid of the Business Equipment Tax and we will reduce Property Taxes by 10% in the first biennium and look at additional Property Tax reductions in the future. We will put side boards in place that will only allow the Sales Tax to be raised by a vote of the people.

Out of control spending at all levels of government have devalued the US dollar and caused prices of common goods, activities and property taxes to spike across the board. This has created less opportunity for our citizens and harbored low moral environment. This leads to crime, poverty and low standard of living. I will work with all members of the Legislature and continue to work with my community toward solutions. Rein in Government spending at all levels, Increase funding where it is needed to fight crime and strive to provide Montanans with a lower cost of living. "

          "answer": "When it comes to high property taxes, the root problem is inflation. Devaluing the US dollar has driven prices higher in every aspect of our lives. Property taxes have risen partly because of inflated home prices, which result in higher tax assessments. Another large problem is the wasteful spending at all levels of government. From DC to City hall. The traditional “spend all you can to get all you can” must stop. I support lowering taxes for Montanans at all levels. Tax caps, Assessment rules and caps, re thinking how we create and maintain budgets at state and local levels. I plan on bringing my common sense business forward, balanced spending approach to help solve the now glaring tax problems we face. "

It provides hard-working, low-paid Montanans access to general medical care and, significantly, care for mental illness and substance abuse when they need it.\n\nMedicaid expansion is keeping urban hospitals and clinics financially healthy and rural critical access hospitals alive.\n\nIt supports about 7,500 jobs and generates about $475 million in personal income and $700 million in economic activity. \n\nFinally, between budget savings and increased tax receipts, Medicaid expansion pays for the state’s investment.\n\nContinuing Medicaid expansion is the right thing to do for Montana’s people, healthcare infrastructure, economy and state budget."

At the end of March 2024, RiverStone Health was down $2.2 million from its anticipated Medicaid revenue. \n\nDPHHS has dropped nursing home residents, individuals in assisted living, disabled people and children from Medicaid not because they were ineligible but because they could not navigate the arcane and disorganized reapplication process.\n\nDPHHS needs a new director."

I do not think it is fair to ask taxpayers to pay for private schools on top of that. I oppose using tax money to support private schools.\n\nIndustrial properties are hard to evaluate and there is a cap on how much their taxes can increase. Residential properties are easy to evaluate and have no cap on increases. We need to look at caps and we need better ways to evaluate industrial property values.\n\nWe need to look at how we tax multi-million dollar vacation properties."

          "answer": "The 2023 Legislature transferred the burden of property tax directly onto homeowners, reducing the burden on corporations and the very wealthy . The most effective way to solve the problem is to re-balance the burden and reduce the residential property tax rate from 1.35% to 0.94%, as the DOR recommended in 2021.\n\nWe need an automatic property tax exemption which provides a tax refund for residents unable to pay specifically veterans and senior citizens.\nWe need to require that large profitable corporations, millionaires, and billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. \n\nEnsuring that the stipulations of SB 442 are enforced is critical to maintaining a healthy tax system in Montana by funding county roads."

I will vote to ratify that base pay increase rate for all state and university employees.\n\nPublic schools were obviously underfunded in both the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions, in part because actual inflation after Covid-19 was much higher than the 3 % cap, causing school funding to fall further and further behind. I will advocate for a more realistic inflation cap to be reviewed annually.\n\n"

I also served four years of active duty in the U.S. Army, where I suffered injuries affecting my mobility.\nBecause of the work I pursued, I understand the needs of Montana's low-income populations, veterans and folks with disablities. As a single woman who raised a grandchild, I can attest to the difficulties faced by Montana families. \nBefore acting, I will ask, \"Who does this help?\""

I would support legalizing abortion and legislation allowing identity care decisions be between patients and doctors.\nOur Montana Constitution also guarantees the right to a clean and healthful environment. We must work at decreasing fossil-fuel consumption and do better at monitoring pollutants in our environment. Low-income, highly industrialized areas, like parts of Laurel, need air quality monitors and better information on the negative effects of pollution on our health.\nOther issues I am concerned with include: access to and protection of public lands; raising the minimum wage; expanding Medicaid; and protecting our agricultural industry."

          "answer": "While property taxes for homeowners has risen about 20%, industry has been given a pass. Overall, large industrial taxes have fallen. As an example NWE, the state's largest taxpayer, saw a decrease of 20%, paying $36 million less than the previous year. Reform of property evaluations need to be instituted, ensuring homeowners don't shoulder so much of the burden.\nTo assist elderly and poor homeowners qualify for relief, I would support a system that automatically enrolls low-income property owners based on their state tax return."

          "answer": "Firstly, the state needs to re-enroll everyone who was kicked off Medicaid during the recent purge. Montana disenrolled more folks faster than almost any other state--adversely affecting not only the health of children and other vulnerable people, but endangering rural health centers and providers, which rely on Medicaid reimbursement to remain in business.\nGiven that the federal government pays 90% of the related costs, Montana legislators should take advantage of that, and further Medicaid expansion.

          "answer": "The funding formula is extremely complex, but based primarily on the number of students enrolled in a school district, with a 3% increase every year. With inflation exceeding that number, the increase needs to at least match inflation so districts can keep up with expenses. Unlike school funding, teacher salaries are paid through the General Fund and determined by the legislature. \nI would support simplifying the formulary for funding schools and providing districts with some spending flexibility depending on their needs. The legislature needs to ensure quality educators are rewarded and should increase teacher base pay.\nNo funds for public schools should be allocated to private charter schools.\n"

Housing is a basic need, and we must fix this to protect the Montana (and Montanans) we love. I propose increasing housing for working families, seniors, and veterans by offering tax incentives, construction grants, and mandating 15% affordable units in new developments. Additional solutions: expand Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), Down Payment Assistance, Housing Choice Vouchers, and emergency rental assistance. I’ll also work with our federal delegation to increase FHA, CDBG, HOME funding, private-public partnerships, USDA initiatives, and to address supply chain issues. We can fix this."

          "answer": "In 2023, the R supermajority had a $2.5 billion surplus but failed to stop this property tax crisis - even killing a bill to cap property taxes relative to household income. Montanans are seeing hikes ranging from 21% to 39% in places like Gallatin County, driving low and fixed-income homeowners to the brink. Montanans deserve better. I will work to expand circuit breaker programs that cap property taxes relative to income, and introduce proposals like a homestead exemption; tax credits for renters, veterans and the elderly; adjusted tax rates for wealthier properties, and taxing of tourism-oriented goods. It's time to overhaul our tax system to provide relief for everyday Montanans, and ensure the tax burden is fair, not rigged. "

          "answer": "My commitment to rural healthcare is deeply personal, stemming from the loss of my father due to lack of access to the care he needed. Over 134,000 Montanans have lost Medicaid since April 2023 due to mismanagement by the current administration. Families are avoiding medical care due to fear of bills - our neighbors & friends are getting sick and in crisis, and we could have avoided it. In MT, Medicaid expansion reduces ER visits, increases preventive care, lowers uncompensated care costs by 35%, and generated $475M in new personal income in 2022. It makes our communities and economy stronger! Medicaid expansion is set to expire in 2025, putting 100,000+ more Montanans at risk. I am deeply committed to reauthorizing Medicaid expansion. "

          "answer": "Montana's school funding formula isn't keeping up with costs. We need to remove the 3% cap on inflationary increases to match real costs and reflect regional cost of living differences - like the booming housing prices in Bozeman. I support keeping in-state college tuition affordable and making community colleges low-cost or free with programs like the Promise Grant. Strengthening trade union apprenticeship programs in public schools is also crucial. My stepfather, who didn’t finish high school, supported our family and built a successful career through an apprenticeship and the carpenters union, and went on to employ 10,000+ union workers. This is our path to a bright future for Montana: educated, trained, competitive and well-paid."

I will legislate for immediate, substantive tax reform; for reauthorizing Medicaid Expansion healthcare for working Montana families; for investment and jobs in Montana's new clean energy economy; and, for improved salaries for teachers and other essential public employees. Last but certainly not least, I'll work to defend our independent judiciary and a long list of threatened constitutional protections, including a woman's right to reproductive freedom. "

          "answer": "The state legislature has dramatically failed in its responsibility to protect taxpayers from unprecedented increases in residential taxes, leaving homeowners stranded and without recourse.

As a member of Senate Finance and Claims with oversight on Montana's healthcare budget, I advocate for affordable health services to all citizens to protect our quality of life, including our robust economy, and to protect against financial disaster that an uninsured health care crisis can represent to Montana families. Mental Health and Behavioral Health [substance abuse] services are especially lacking across the state, notably in rural communities.

          "answer": "State school districts are in crisis, fighting for their fiscal health given regressive state laws that threaten the quality and availability of Montana public education. Montana trails the nation in budgeting for public education by a staggering $1,000 per student. And, state law prohibits schools from tracking actual inflation -- instead they must use a three-year trailing average. In today's inflated world that means schools can't keep up, losing significant spending power annually, which threatens the loss of programs, personnel and capacity. Why force our schools to bootstrap their budgets? Meanwhile, let's raise teacher pay and advance laws requiring that ALL public education dollars go to locally-governed public school districts. "

If elected I would love the opportunity to serve on both educational policy & budget committees. \nWe are heading into the 10 year cycle of reassessing the school funding formula. \nWe need to assess the inflationary funding cap at a 3% max. We know that the increases just to keep the lights on have far exceed a 3% increase. Additionally, the needs of students continue to increase. \nRecruitment & Retention is extremely difficult, causing staffing to be at crisis levels. Looking at opportunities to increase funding to pay better and offer better benefits is critical. \nAgain, I support Early Childhood, K-12 & Higher Ed. I am proud to have a 100% voting record for public education. "

I am a former advisor and consultant with over 35 years of experience working with over 1,400 businesses across the country.\nA resident of Montana for over 25 years, I graduated from South Dakota State and attained several advanced degrees in business in the US and Europe. \nI have been inspired to run for office due to shifting issues. I have worked from the ground up meeting with varying individuals and groups listening to concerns. My reputation is getting business done, on time and on budget. I believe that I am the only candidate who is actively working for the people of Montana and I will do everything in my power to tilt the scales to the people."

          "answer": "From my window there are many factors that are driving the train off the track in Montana. The Legislature/Government is ignoring the people and making life more difficult for long standing residents. Changes in the tax system that rewards out of state and high-income corporations places more burdens on the everyday worker. In addition, the Legislature is extremely driven to intrude on a woman’s right to privacy and wants to make healthcare decisions on their behalf.\nI propose to back off the recent tax reductions for out of state companies and increase the tax rate on ultra-wealthy individuals. Along with this is to suspend property tax increases for senior citizens. Lastly, I would initiate protections to women, and health providers "

          "answer": "Taxes have increased 26% on average under the present administration which is more then a significant number of the population can afford. Meanwhile, the governor and Republicans decided to give away a billion dollars of the Montanan’s tax money to out of state corporations and the ultra-wealthy. In the same period, schools, county and local government have experienced inflation at levels not seen since the 1980’s.  The legislature needs to modernize the participation rate to the local government/schools which is a better use of the tax resources. I support repeal of the tax measures, lowering the rate for large taxpayers. In addition, I would insist the DOR discontinue clandestinely negotiating tax rates with the largest tax payers."

This is an embarrassing footnote for the state.\nMontana needs to renew Medicaid Expansion.

I propose that the state increase its funding levels to the state’s public schools. Inflation has been devastating and is only compounding the problem statewide. Many of the increase expenditures for schools benefit the state and it's only right to transfer the liability back to the state."

How can we educate our youth if we don't show support for schools. This past year Montana had about 10% of the  teacher positions open. How is that benefiting our children? We also passed, but it thrown out in court laws which would have allowed mining waste water to be dirtier than the federal rules permit. The federal rules as are base line which a state can make more stringent. However, our legislature and governor decided it was Montanans' best interest to have the the dirtiest water in the nation. There is no looking into the future in Helena, all vision is nearsighted. "

A sales tax would negatively affect year-round residents and only benefit the rich part-timers who do not spend a high percentage of their money in Montana. We need to tax vacation house rentals such as Air B&Bs, as commercial properties. This revenue can be used to offset residential taxes.

Many Montanans need the financial help that this program affords. Without Medicaid, many citizens would not see a health care professional when they first feel sick due to cost. It has been proven that it is way more cost effective to have expanded Medicaid than to have to pay emergency room expenses and to help prevent catastrophic illnesses which are more expensive to treat. Without expanded medicaid, many rural health care facilities would have to shut their doors. Then we are putting a burden on families to travel great distances to see loved ones."

They should not expect our tax dollars to help fund this private education. One of the greatest success stories is public education in the US. We need to educate the next generation of Montanans, with a poor education system our children will leave the state. "

She was on a company plane coming back from Coalstrip when it crashed killing her shortly before my second birthday. To find relief from the tragedy my father moved us to the Bitterroot Valley where I have remained. I attended high school in Corvallis and learned my work ethic on the farms and ranches around there. I attended school in Ohio but quickly came back. I have lived and fished the Bitterroot River most of my life. I currently live on Lolo Creek.\n\nBeing from here means I’ve seen a lot of growth, both good and bad. I am determined to protect farmland, wildland, our streams, and our stream access."

Montana is bottom 10 in wages and top 10 in housing costs.\n\nThe answers are there. We need more houses and we need higher wages. If the bank is invested in keeping housing costs high they will never finance enough new homes to lower the prices. Some of the next budget surplus needs to directly fund new housing.\n\nSome of the surplus should go to raising the wages government controls. Montana is 51st nationwide in starting teacher wages. We have a teacher shortage. Wildland firefighters get paid less than Taco Bell employees. We can fix that."

          "answer": "The solution is simple we do what every legislature over the last 40 years did until the current GOP supermajority raised them. When Montana property values changed the legislature has adjusted the Mill Rate to prevent major tax hikes or schools funding cuts. The last session the Department of Revenue told the Republicans that controlled everything, that to keep Montana residential property tax neutral they had to adjust the Mill Rate from 1.34 to 0.95… they didn’t do it. They passed massive permanent tax cuts for corporations and millionaires and then let the largest tax hike in the history of Montana fall on working class families.\n\nWe have to adjust that rate."

If it doesn’t pass the hospital in Superior will close. Right now Montana DPHHS is millions behind in Medicaid payments to these hospitals. The other party has a definite policy to try to defund all Medicaid. Under Gianforte’s failed leadership Medicaid Expansion can only be passed and protected by a strong opposition party.\n\nMontanans’ healthcare access is on the ballot."

          "answer": "Our current system of only funding schools and counties with property taxes is not adequate. Change will be slow but creating some other revenue sources is the only way we can shift the burden off residential home owners and renters. In the meantime our massive property tax increases mean we should have another surplus, some of that can be used to supplement the school budgets until we find more equitable solutions."

          "answer": "To reduce property taxes for everyday Montanans, we can implement a Housing Fairness Credit, providing relief to families with lower and moderate incomes. Coupling this with a homestead exemption would further alleviate the burden on homeowners. Instead of income tax rate reductions benefiting the wealthy, the focus should shift toward fairer taxation, like a top income tax bracket for high earners. This ensures everyone contributes their fair share, aligning with Montana values of community responsibility. Such measures address rising property taxes and promote equity and stability in our revenue system, benefiting all Montanans."

          "answer": "I wholeheartedly support Medicaid expansion as a means to enhance healthcare access. Before Medicaid expansion, there was a gap where many couldn't afford coverage, leaving them uninsured and increasing healthcare costs for everyone. Ensuring affordable coverage is crucial as the cost of living rises, impacting people's ability to meet basic needs. Access to healthcare isn't just about financial costs; it's about enabling participation in communities—working, volunteering, supporting families—that enriches society. Continuing Medicaid expansion past 2025 is essential for fostering healthier communities and ensuring everyone can access the care they need to thrive. In turn, thriving communities support productive people. "

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",

I now live north of Polebridge, Montana next to Glacier National Park surrounded by public land. I am a retired public-school teacher and principal. I served as the Representative for House District 3 for more than a year after being appointed to fill a vacancy in 2019. \n\nI have a proven track record of working with diverse groups of people to reach consensus on important issues. My leadership and public service as a public-school teacher and principal, conservation advocate, community leader, and former Montana state representative have prepared me to be an effective legislator..

I will work with other legislators to develop solutions to these challenges facing us."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The first thing that needs to happen is for the Legislature to fulfill its constitutional obligation to equalize taxation between corporations and residential property taxes. The Legislature has failed to maintain equalization and while residential property taxes increased by $259 million last year, corporate taxes declined by $76 million. Notably, while our homes are assessed at their full market value, corporations are allowed to negotiate their values. We need to have tax fairness.\n\nSecond, we can institute a homestead exemption (which would be a reduction of the taxable value) for homeowners who reside fulltime in Montana and pay their income taxes in Montana and would not be available for those with second and third homes here. \n"

          "answer": "It is vitally important that the Legislature pass Medicaid Expansion in 2025 for the sake of Montana citizens, our rural hospitals, and our economy. If the Legislature fails to pass this, thousands of hard-working Montanans and children will go without healthcare insurance. Our economy needs a healthy workforce, and our education system needs healthy children. Most of our rural hospitals and clinics depend upon Medicaid to keep their doors open. Medicaid is not a hand-out; it provides affordable healthcare insurance for low income workers and their families. 80% of the cost of Medicaid comes from the federal government rather than Montana. It is essential that we do not turn this federal money away at the expense of our citizens."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "We need to: (1) Change the State Funding Formula for Public Schools to alleviate chronic budget shortfalls and not force schools to rely so heavily on local property taxes and annual school levies; (2) Recruit and Retain Quality Teachers by raising starting teacher salaries which are the lowest in the nation; (3) Special Allocation for Public School Infrastructure to maintain minimum school building standards and the necessary technology needed for a quality education. \nThe Legislature has a constitutional duty to provide a quality public education for every child in Montana."

The tax burden ought to be shared equally across all property owners whether it be business, industry, or private/residential.

          "answer": "Physical and mental health care services are essential to the well being of all Montanans. Over 130,00 people have lost health insurance coverage between 4/23 and 1/24. Montana currently ranks 3rd in the nation for suicide, Flathead County is 3rd in the state. All residents in Montana are impacted negatively by poor physical and mental health of its residents be that by lost job productivity or citizens’ contributions to the community. Research indicates that economic effects of expanding healthcare coverage to low income Montanans would introduce $650 million into the economy each year, support 6,000 new jobs, and add $400 million in personal income. It is the job of the Legislature to enhance and improve access to healthcare services. "

          "answer": "Montana currently ranks last the country for starting teacher pay. There are currently over 1,000 job openings throughout the state in education. Public education is the ultimate equalizer in our society for individuals of any background, ethnicity, and income level to establish a path toward success and achievement in life. Funding public education is the primary job of the legislature. In order to provide quality education to our children, teachers must be paid a living wage, curriculum must be inclusive and varied, and our educational structures must be maintained appropriately. Property owners be they individuals or entities must have commiserate amounts of responsibility in funding our education system. "

I think it would be worth discussing a flat tax and fair distribution of education dollars regardless of the prosperity of a given district. Education is such a great investment in the state and should include college, vocational education, apprenticeships, and especially preschool through grade 12.\nSolving this problem will take out-of the-box thinking which may make some people uncomfortable.

I plan to collaborate with politicians across party lines to provide more affordable options to Montanans.\nWomen's Health and Rights: I will work to keep Montanan women safe, and keep politics out of peoples Dr. offices.\nEducation: I will work to provide supported teachers, safe schools, and uncensored quality educational materials.\nMental Health Services: I will use my first hand experiences to expand and develop more mental health community services.\nDiversity: I will advocate for all of Montanan's minorities and work to develop more safe and diverse communities."

          "answer": "The state legislature needs to stop hitting Montanans with increased costs and payments on the state level.  Decreasing taxes on lower income people and increasing taxes for ultra wealthy would be a start. We need to create more affordable housing options including subsidized properties.

I will use my first hand experience in the healthcare field to develop more community mental health services both in-patient and out-patient.

          "answer": "Again, unfortunately we need to correct and clean-up the errors that were made by the current leadership. The education system is struggling and I will work to increase any type of funding for our public education system. I feel passionately about finding ways to increase pay to our teachers so we can attract and retain high quality educators.

During my career in interacted with county and state governments frequently. I proposed legislation and had to contend with the changes in legislation, both good and bad. At my retirement I was managing a 34 million dollar budget and two years in a row I turned money back to the Sheriff's main budget. Since my retirement I worked for a company that wrote policy for Public Safety in multiple states and am familiar with reading the law. "

In addition some employers are using illegal immigrants as labor to unfairly compete with business of more integrity. We need to pass laws that deter their presence in our state and make hiring them illegal. \nOur mental health system is failing, this is obvious when Warm Springs was delicensed. The result is when Law Enforcement encounters the mentally ill they often charge them and jail them instead of sending them into the state mental health system which has no bed space. This results in less space in our jails. "

          "answer": "First the Montana property owner must be protected from the unpredictable swings in property values and the value assessment system. For the purposes of taxes the property values need to be frozen. The state needs to further diversify its tax structure so no single source carries the burden of funding services. This state is abundant in natural resources, but our efficient use of these (a source of tax revenue) has been hampered by overzealous environmental concerns. We need to offer reasonable solutions so that these resources are reengaged as part of our economy. Tourism is bringing billions of dollars to this state, but there is also an impact to our services and roads. We need to expand how we collect fees from those who come to visit."

          "answer": "I think part of the problem is that many taxes payers are unsatisfied with what they see is going on in education and are unwilling to pay more for what they see as a broken system. I have spoken to many parents who are disturbed by what they see as the promotion of alternate sexual life styles and transgenderism in our education system. Our schools need to return to their core function and that is teaching them the skills to be productive members of our society i.e.: reading, writing, history, arithmetic, science. etc. Voters feel disenfranchised from their school boards who tend to be dominated by people from one side of the political spectrum. As long as these issues continue, funding will be difficult. "

Additionally, this money gets spent at local businesses and strengthens our economy. When it comes to providing more mental health, housing and general health resources, we can see data trends indicating that increasing funding to these programs results in a decrease in crime.

I had to move out of state to get my Master's in Social Work but moved back to our favorite state purposefully 15 years ago.  I just turned 70, widowed and retired.  I spent my career working in mental health crisis intervention, case management for the seriously mentally ill, and administration of non-profit mental health agencies.  I have learned to understand that things can always change for the better and how to work hard to make that change happen. "

This should be a bipartisan issue but it initially passed by only a few votes. We mustn't take it for granted. Medicaid Expansion has improved the health of our community members, of our work force, and is vital to the well being of our small rural hospitals we all depend on.  A second huge priority is fixing Montana's broken mental health system. We simply cannot do this successfully without Medicaid Expansion. Legislation in both of these areas will be coming from Legislative Leadership and I will do everything I can to help develop it and get it passed. "

          "answer": "Tax policy has been an interest of mine ever since I first ran for office eight years ago.  I have studied with experts in Montana revenue, but it is complex.  The recent bust up in property taxes could have been managed using a current mitigation process already known in the Legislature, but the Republican supermajority leadership failed to bring it forward despite prompting by the Democrat minority.  We should make that happen correctly this upcoming session. But our entire Montana tax system needs updating and correction. Our tax brackets are regressive. We need to restore the top tax brackets that were changed in 2003 and repeal tax expenditures that benefit fossil fuel extraction and off shore corporations. "

          "answer": "In the short run we must get Medicaid Expansion passed and let's get the insulin cap passed, too. In the long run, I believe we need to have a physical and mental health care system that is non profit and centrally managed as many other countries have successfully developed. In the interim, we need to fund services sufficiently, consistently and expertly rather than by a haphazard process of providing grants. I am a strong supporter of women's rights to a full range of reproductive health services and will promote access to free birth control.  Prenatal and post partum care need to be greatly enhanced. Supporting community based systems such as Community Health Centers and state employee clinics moves us towards coordinated care. "

          "answer": "As recently as 2016 half our states had not returned to pre 2008 levels of funding for education following the Great Recession. Montana's state share of higher education funding versus tuition has dropped from 76 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2019. The funding recipe for public schools is an attempt to balance local and state and federal funding but it is incredibly complicated. I don't think tinkering will fix it. We need to modernize our tax code as noted above, get our revenue solidified and increase the overall level of funding for the entire range of education.  Funding public pre K helps educate children and let parents work so let's make that happen.  We must target more robust aid to our schools. "

Even a well read and totally concentrated person would have a difficult time to comment effectively on over 1500 bills introduced.\n Also, there should be a legal review of bills so they don't end up clogging the courts.\n The big issues of course are higher property taxes affecting middle incomes and seniors; health care for all; supporting the Public School system.

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",
          "answer": "Born in Ironton, MO., I'm 61 & have lived in Montana for 40 years moving here after I completed my education from the State of Kansas Regent System where I attained my professional education to be a Mortician. The last 26 years I have made St. Ignatius my residence with my wife , Phyllis Haynes. We own Foster Funeral Home & Crematory with locations in St. Ignatius & Browning. We sold Browning in Nov. 2023 to make time for my wife's recovery from a liver transplant. I am an excellent candidate because like many in my district  my wife is a member of the CSKT, & our business is incorporated under the Tribe. However, since my families ancestry is from OK we follow Federal, State & Tribal laws/rules and understand how they work together."

          "answer": "In our area it has to be retro-session of the Public Law. In the past legislators have been able to pass only modest solutions to the problem and the State has yet to fund it. For this reason I would advocate that the State withdraw and let the Reservations function more as Sovereign Nations under the Yakama Accord unless their is a compact or federal mandate to have the State government act in that capacity. That way the Federal Government would have address the issue and possibly could come up with a solution."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "I would set property values at the price a family paid for the property. Commercial property (non agriculture based) would retain the current system. I am for property tax relief but this does not affect most of HD15 as the majority of my constituents have property in Trust Status and massive areas of this district are recognized wilderness areas."

          "answer": "Expansion should be sought., However, accountability standards should be enacted on recipients. Limits to discretionary spending of funds by the recipient should be put into force that would restrict their purchasing of alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes and gaming.\nIn regards to our state run facilities which have been under scrutiny and seem to be failing we should look to see if privatization is better for them."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Having a father that has been a member of the State Of Kansas Regents Board, I have seen him struggle with this issue and there is not an easy boiler plate answer to it. \n Most solutions are not pleasant but consolidation is usually necessary evil & the offering of duplicate courses must be examined. Most states with populations as sparse as Montana do not have as many colleges as Montana does. As for k-12 funding it should be based upon number of students that live within a district. By doing this home school, private school, & charter school families still contribute to the solution. Also because of the amount of federal and state lands that some districts have negotiations would be appropriate to have them raise their contributions."

We must remove the 3% cap on funding increases and have increases commensurate with the actual inflation rates.\n3.\tThe legislature must protect our right to privacy and guard against the erosion of our personal rights, which have been under attack by our current legislature.

          "answer": "Our current property tax laws are overly complex and need reform. They currently favor big business at the expense of ordinary homeowners. I would recommend an equalization of property tax contributions between the different entities that are required to pay property tax at this time. This would prevent any entity from having to bear more than their fair share of the tax burden, which is exactly what happened in 2023 with the rising residential property taxes and the lowering of big business property taxes. The current system unfairly burdens the citizens who can least afford it. "

          "answer": "Our public schools are the backbone of our communities and the focal point for civic engagement and unity. Strong public schools translate to strong communities that can thrive. Support for our public schools is of utmost importance. The current trend by our legislature to privatize education through charter schools or community choice schools is eroding that vital support. Charter schools should be rare and need a far more rigorous approval process. Community choice schools are unconstitutional and siphon tax dollars to pay for private education and should never be allowed. We cannot afford to lose any of our current public school funding and need to seek other funding sources that do not require increasing local property taxes. "

          "answer": "In 1975, I moved to MT from PA and married a 3rd generation Montanan. We raised 3 children in Great Falls. I have a BS in Art Ed. and a BS in Forest Science with post-grad in Outdoor Rec. from UM & Clemson U. As a F.S. employee, I connected with rural communities & learned first-hand how wildfire impacts private property. At the L&C Interpretive Center, I created programming & many public-private partnerships. I led public meetings, met with the media, and kept govt. officials informed. Starting in 2010, I served as Cascade County Commissioner for 10 years, so understand local govt. I prepared county budgets & policies and much more. All of these experiences will enable me to quickly understand legislative issues."

Corporations & centrally assessed properties are exempt from paying their fair share & seniors are being priced out of their homes. Also, personal property tax relief reduces taxable income essential for public education, mental health, and local government funding. \nThe legislature can and must do better to fund our public education system and provide incentives to increase teacher salaries.\n"

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Unfair tax exemptions for centrally assessed properties shifted the tax burden to Class 3 properties. Property taxes have not been equalized despite DOR advice on using a previously used multiplier for calculations. The multiplier should be applied. Another idea might be a 5-10 year phased tax increase or a % exemption for first-time homebuyers and/or senior homeowners. Centrally assessed property & large corporate exemptions should be eliminated so they pay their fair share. The Ag Exemption should also be re-visited, as some property owners in high-valued recreational areas use the Ag exemption to reduce their taxes. The Personal Property tax rate should also be reviewed because equipment exemptions are too high. "

          "answer": "Re-authorization of Medicaid Expansion is essential for preventative healthcare & to keep working families healthy. To increase access to care, FQHCs or look-alikes could provide child & adult physical/dental/mental health services through our public schools. MT also desperately needs mental health crisis facilities with residential services to stabilize Montanans in crisis & move them toward full recovery. Funding should prevent crisis patients from being “warehoused” in detention facilities where they do not receive appropriate services. Montanans deserve timely assessments so they can receive mental medical services, regain their balance, return to work and provide for their families. "

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Inflation impacts school budgets. Schools have difficulties attracting/retaining teachers & support staff. The school funding formula is fundamentally sound with the exception of not having adjusted to the increasing costs the education system is facing. The school funding formula relies heavily on the number of students. Schools with decreasing or stagnant enrollment are unable to operate without substantial operational reductions. Adjusting the formula to reduce its reliance on student numbers would be a step in the right direction. Additional state funding reducing the tax burden on property taxpayers is one adjustment consideration. Safety & technology needs should be factored in as essential components of the formula for schools."

I also see a failure of the State to provide adequate resources for mental health, and I would like to advocate for the establishment of modern mental health facilities utilizing a portion of the State's budget surplus. Health care in general needs work, and the legislature owes it to citizens to take it seriously and improve the system."

I would like to advocate for a Land Value Tax structure in urban areas that would facilitate infill and development of vacant parcels. I would like to avoid increasing tax assessments on true agricultural grounds as much as possible, and reassess how Ag exemptions for parcels under 20 acres are handled.

I would like to see funds directed to preventative care resources, and modern facilities in areas with the infrastructure to support adequate staffing dedicated to mental health care.

          "answer": "As someone whose spouse was an educator, and left due to a lack of adequate resources, I will stand by the validity of the first part of this statement. I am skeptical of any proposal that diverts public funding to private institutions, and I want to advocate for adequate funding of PUBLIC education at all levels, including vocational re-training programs. I believe revenue that was intended to be directed to the public school system has been chipped away at over the years and the current level of funding is inadequate, as evidenced by the relatively low rate of teacher pay compared to other States. I think any proposal must consider impacts to rural schools with limited resources, and must set them up for success as well as urban centers."

As a lifelong Montana resident and Great Falls born and raised I have more in common with the average Montanan than any out of state politician or disproportionately wealthy individual. My experiences as a small business owner and traditional family man have shaped my conservative ideology, however in those roles I am pragmatic in order to bring different ideologies together to resolve conflicts and get the job done. At the end of the day we are all Montanans and we want to continue to enjoy the freedoms and quality of living we deserve."

          "answer": "The most pressing issues for most Montanans include the rising cost of housing, economic instability, and community safety. To move forward I would propose or support legislation to put limits on the increase or decrease of property taxes, as well as exploring ways to tax property that provides an incentive to build more housing (high land tax, low house tax). I also would support legislation to lower the taxes on small local businesses. In order to grow our economy I think Montana needs to be consuming more of the product it produces, and our young adults need another option after high school in the form of trade and vocational apprenticeships. As new a father of two, I also support keeping communities safe and the ability to self defend."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "I think local services are very important, but the property taxes are chasing the appraisal value and not the financial demand of those services. What would it look like if we calculated property tax in a different way, and what if we had a number to look at for government services instead of just letting them use whatever budget happens to come together? I think Montana is starting to grow exponentially as one of the last strongholds of true American values in the country, we must be careful and protect the longstanding Montana residents by being priced out by the affluent newcomers. This happens to every tourist economy. We should prioritize keeping costs low for Montana residents and increase costs for newcomers and affluent investors."

          "answer": "I think we should figure out what the costs of such services would be to provide care for all deserving Montanans that cannot afford private Healthcare. I wonder why these costs are never figured out first and why we pass legislation and figure out what it costs later. The way things should work is that we calculate the max revenue that can be generated through fair tax, and then allocate the funding to all programs needed for Montana to function. If the numbers aren't enough then we have to look at ways to tax. Government should be run like a business that represents the citizens, it should be invested in the best benefits for the people at the lowest cost to them and their freedoms. "

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "I think Montana teachers should have ratings that are based on student enjoyment, participation, and other indicators of their efficacy as an educator. Each rating should have significant pay increase as an incentive to be a super educator who is liked by students, parents, and staff. High schools and Universities should have basic and equal allocation for extra curricular activities, but extraordinary development like building a state of the art gym or art studio should come from external income like donations, ticket sales, and specific grants. Shop classes and vocational programs should be hiring out their students to local businesses to fill the labor gap and provide more income for school. It all goes back to thinking more profitably."

I have to believe that the school system can do a better job with what they have. Personally, my property taxes have doubled in the last 7 years. I know in some Montana commuities it is much worse. Forcing seniors out of thier homes from high property taxes is not the caring type of state I want to live in. Education is very important in our society but I don't believe more funding is the answer. Educators have an insatiable desire for funding and asking them to live within thier means is not unreasonable."

Ranches and farms are unable to compete and \nmaintain solvency. We find many residents here in their vacation homes. We have a \nburgeoning tourist industry that needs resources. Our land usage demands that we are \nrespectful of our heritage and history while maintaining our responsibilities to the resident \ntribes. We must foster our wildlife with safety and freedom. All of this leads to the \nentrance of a more diversified citizenry."

Transportation to receive these services calls for a pooling of specialties and blending them into a meaningful access directory. Our social services and childcare services need codification and stabilization. As a member of the retired community, the state through the legislature must address developing a continuum of care assisting in defining services, facilities and decision-making processes. We must address and confront the horrifying \nfact that we are the state with the highest suicide rate in the nation."

          "answer": "I was brought into the state of Nevada by its governor to prove to his legislature that you can \nget a quality education from any place in that state. This was accomplished that with \nincreased, seamless connectivity to state and nationwide resources. With our fully \narticulated mapped curriculum, project-based learning is possible. We must address all of \nour instructional domains: cognitive, affective, psycho-motor, emotional and social. We \nneed to explore and allow solutions within the classroom: a master teacher model, \nlearning style instruction, 4MAT, dual credit programs."

          "answer": "Born in Anaconda, Montana. \n59 years old. \nPermanent resident of Havre, Montana. \nExecutive Director of Bear Paw Development Corporation for the past 24 years. \nBachelor's degree from the University of Montana.\n\nI have worked in the nonprofit economic and community development sector of northern Montana's economy for nearly 30 years, the past 24 years serving five counties and two reservations in the Havre area. \n\nI have spent the vast majority of my career working to help communities grow and prosper. Through financing small business start-ups and expansions, I have assisted entrepreneurs in northern Montana create jobs, expand the tax base, and make our Main Streets more vibrant. "

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "I strongly support property tax reform that provides relief to residential and small business property owners. The last legislature failed to adjust property tax rates following the most recent reappraisal cycle. This caused undue hardship on small businesses and homeowners. We need to fix this in the 2025 legislative session. \n\nIn 2025, the legislature must also reauthorize Medicaid Expansion. Failing to do so will cause countless Montanans to lose medical coverage, will forgo $900 million of federal investment into Montana's Medicaid Expansion program and will cause more than 7,500 health care workers to lose their jobs. In rural Montana, failure to reauthorize Medicaid Expansion will very likely cause health facilities to close. "
        },

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The legislature needs to adjust property tax rates for homeowners and small businesses so the increase due to the most recent reappraisal cycle is mitigated. \n\nWe should also look at the possibility of creating another property tax classification for non-Montanans who have second and third vacation homes in our state but currently pay the same rate as Montana families do for their family home. \n\nProperty tax rates should be fair and not unduly burden Montana residents while allowing wealthy out of state property owners a tax haven. "

          "answer": "The very first thing the Montana legislature should address with regard to health care in our state is the reauthorization of Medicaid Expansion, which is scheduled to expire in 2025. This program provides health care for scores of lower income Montanans, most of whom are in the workforce and contributing members of society. \n\nThis program allows rural hospitals and health clinics to stay afloat and provides jobs for more than 7,500 health care workers in Montana. \n\nMedicaid Expansion is also a great financial deal for the State of Montana, with the federal government picking up 80% of the cost of the program, which equates to $900 million a year into our economy.

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "The Montana legislature should invest wisely in the proper education of our children, especially since these students will become our state's future workforce. Appropriating funds to help local school districts with the rising cost of providing a quality education to our children is an important first step to take to both bolster education at the local level and also mitigate the need for school districts to raise mill levies to fund their operation. \n\nI will also continue to support investing in vocational education in Montana to assure we have Montana residents who can afford to attend trade schools and vocational programs. I had a bill to do this last session and will continue to do what is possible to enhance the trades in Montana."

I worked in a grocery store ,washed dishes, trimmed trees, worked for farmers & ranchers. When I was laid off from the Railroad I went back to ranch work, and spent one winter on oil rigs. The different jobs all over the state gives me a perspective of what it takes to raise a family, buy a home, and live the Montana dream, This of course while paying my taxes."

Medicaid expansion; Property Taxes; Affordable housing .Depending on your age, income or location, I believe these top the list. Not only does Medicaid help provide a safety net for low income families, it helps stabilize rural clinics. If you can't afford health insurance, you probably can't afford to drive long distances to clinics or the hospital. Affordable housing is more complex; a mix of proposals: such as subsides; tax incentives; Board of investments for infrastructure to lower capital start up. Property taxes is the next question."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The tax rates increases due to accessed higher values can be changed to equalize residential and corporations. For instance Northwestern Energy, after getting a huge rate hike, pays lower rates in Blaine county then residents. Helping counties with marijuana tax money for roads, schools, law enforcement. Also lowering the residential property multiplier against residential appraised value."

I care about families and children. I have good problem solving skills, I'm flexible, determined, and fair. I have been at the negotiating table to bargain for fair wages and good working conditions.

The last legislature had opportunities to fix this situation and voted against them. I support ways to equalize how property taxes are distributed among commercial, utilities, and other land owners.\nOur health care system in Montana is another pressing concern for 2025. Without the renewal of Medicaid Expansion, our rural hospitals and health care system will be at risk. This decision will impact all of us. I will support the renewal of Medicaid Expansion.\nAnother pressing issue is public education. Our public school teachers are some of the lowest paid in the country. I support public education."

If we don't renew Medicaid Expansion, we will lose federal funding. We will see a rise in closures of medical facilities. We will see more medical bankruptcies. People will get sicker. I intend to listen to our folks who run hospitals and medical facilities in order to learn how the legislature can best serve them. \nMental health is also an area to address. We have seen a rise in mental health issues among all ages since the pandemic. Instead of cutting these programs that address these needs, I will vote to fund these programs adequately. "

Through my education in art, I learned both how to understand clearly what I observe, and how to communicate clearly through visual cues.

The irony is that we already have a state constitution that promises protections for privacy, a healthy environment and a fair tax system - a great deal can be accomplished if we stop writing unconstitutional laws, and stop wasting taxpayer money on defending them in court.\n"

          "answer": "While the state constitution demands that all property in the state must be equalized for tax purposes, the distribution of the property tax burden is set by the legislature through designating classes of property, tax rates, exemptions, phase-ins, and the basis of valuation. We currently have an unequal tax system where only homeowners must pay the full value of their property, while businesses and corporations enjoy exemptions and rate caps. I support fully equalizing our property tax system to give tax relief to homeowners, and reducing tax breaks from utilities and businesses who are already making excessive profits.\n"

Given that Medicaid reduces the health care cost burden on individuals and small businesses, keeps children healthy and enables them to access their education, and enables more people to work and support their families, all Montanans would benefit from continuing Medicaid expansion when it returns to the legislature next year in 2025.\n"

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Montana currently spends less per student than the national average in other states, and we have the lowest teacher pay in the nation. A well-educated community improves quality of life, creates more stable and productive local economies, reduces crime and improves public safety. In this context, the lack of adequate investment in our education is showing. Splitting dollars off for individual students to pay for private education reduces the efficiency of Montana’s already tight budget. Rather than raise taxes on working Montanans, I support placing a higher budget priority on public education without diversion to private schools through reducing tax breaks for the large corporations and equalizing our property tax formula."

Inflation is hurting everyone and is caused primarily by our out-of-control federal government spending. There are many important issues, but if we as individuals, and us as a state and country can’t pay our bills, the rest of the issues don’t rise above that on the priority level. Having said that, I am for tax reduction and reducing the size of the government. This is a freedom issue, because the more money and power we give to our government, the more freedoms we are sacrificing as citizens. Finally, we must work to ensure our safety through stringent enforcement of laws, particularly those that address substance use and its impact on crime in our community."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "An issue as complicated as this will not be easily resolved. The fact is that the state portion of our property taxes is a small percentage of our overall tax bill, while the majority are local taxes. The state portion of our property taxes is used to pay for schools. I would not support taking that money away from the schools. Local citizens have more control of the local property taxes, as many of those are voted on levies. The system already set by legislature is working, but the citizens have to be open to alternative ideas to tax revenue to reduce their income and property tax burden. As legislators, being open and honest with the citizens is the best way to communicate the ideas that may come forward. "

          "answer": "The Legislature has taken steps and should continue to take steps to encourage mental and physical health care providers to practice in Montana, especially rural Montana. In addition, the new medical schools in Montana are providing opportunities for home grown physicians to stay and practice in Montana, and we need to encourage more of this."

          "answer": "Montana’s school funding formula is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to understand. The entire school funding formula should be simplified to ensure that taxes are allocated in the appropriate manner to uphold Montana’s constitutional mandate “to provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.” The Montana Constitution further states “The legislature may provide such other educational institutions, public libraries, and educational programs as it deems desirable.”  I am a big supporter of Career and Technical Education programs that need to be encouraged and financially supported by both the state and private industry."

Long wait times, and weeks on weeks waiting for determination only to be kicked off is unacceptable.

          "answer": "The funding structure we currently have and the burden it places on our local communities needs to be reevaluated. Montana's current spending per student falls below the national average, while our teacher salaries rank as the lowest in the country. Investing in education not only enhances quality of life but also fosters stronger local economies, reduces crime, and boosts public safety. However, the lack of sufficient funding for education is evident. Diverting funds to private education diminishes the effectiveness of Montana's limited budget. Instead of burdening working Montanans with tax hikes, I advocate prioritizing public education by reducing tax breaks for large corporations and revising our property tax system to ensure fairness."

However, Medicaid expansion is undoubtedly the most pressing issue heading into the 2025 session. Medicaid expansion keeps Montanans healthy & working especially those working in jobs which are critical to the economy such as childcare or other service sector jobs. I support legislation that lifts the sunset on Medicaid expansion & would also support permanently removing the sunset. Expansion keeps the doors open on our rural hospitals and keeps the uncompensated care costs down. Medicaid expansion improves healthcare for all Montanans."

          "answer": "3)\tA once-in-a-generation opportunity to fully invest in a better, affordable Montana for all was wasted when the legislature chose to prioritize significant tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent, and chose to dish out multiple one-time rebates instead of utilizing the historic surplus towards any type of long-term policy solutions. Families with the lowest incomes are paying a greater share of their income in State and Local taxes, and residential taxpayers (ie, homeowners and renters) are paying a greater share of property taxes. I support legislation that will reduce property taxes for those whose property taxes exceed a percentage of their incomes and require corporations and those with higher incomes to pay their fair share of taxes."

          "answer": "First & foremost, pass Medicaid expansion. The federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion; the state pays the remaining 10%. Expansion improves heath care access for all Montanans by providing more options for mental health & substance abuse treatments, increases services offered at Indian Health Service facilities and provides greater access to preventive care & early screenings which lead to healthier and better lives. Expansion brings in millions in new federal spending creating jobs, helps maintain a healthy workforce & promotes economic growth."

          "answer": "5)\tA strong public education system not only benefits the individual student but plays a crucial role in the development of an informed and engaged citizenry. Quality public education ensures that individuals have the tools to learn, adapt and thrive throughout their lives and strengthens communities by fostering collaboration and shared responsibility. The State needs to focus on investing more resources and money into our public education systems rather than diverting public funds to support private schools. The school funding formula is complex and does not adequately fund larger school districts. I support looking at ways to improve the school funding formula to address this funding gap."

As a new parent, I’ve learned to keep my eye on the bigger picture and what to prioritize. I’ve also deepened my ability to hold boundaries during emotionally charged moments.

I am in favor of almost any tax credits and subsidies, especially those that go directly to the resident. The last legislature made progress in increasing the number of living units available, but now it’s time to work on making sure Montanans can afford what is available. The Legislature also needs to continue to protect the rights of mobile home owners against out-of-state corporations intent on pricing them out of their communities."

          "answer": "During the legislature, the Governor and Republican supermajority could have acted on the advice of the Department of Revenue and adjusted the property tax rate to account for the recent increases in property values. Instead, they frittered time away giving tax breaks to the wealthy and big businesses.\n\nBig property tax payers – like big corporations, owners of railroads and mines – have a cap on how much their property taxes can increase, but homeowners do not. We have to enact long-term property tax relief plans that protect middle class Montanans from footing the bill that gives big corporations a tax break."

          "answer": "Everyone deserves healthcare, no exceptions. Being able to maintain your health is part of living a free and satisfying life. Many people in our communities are struggling with chronic disease or addiction and can’t afford care. The legislature must continue Medicaid expansion past 2025. Medicaid expansion is a great deal for Montana. It has been a crucial tool for helping many of our friends and neighbors get or stay healthy enough to work or get an education. Medicaid expansion has created good paying jobs across the state, helped keep healthcare accessible in rural Montana, and it costs the state pennies on the dollar to maintain."

          "answer": "One of the most valuable investments that we can make is in the education of our children. Having an educated community increases public safety and improves the quality of our workforce. I am in favor of improving our school spending formula to increase the funding available for schools.

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",
          "answer": "I was born in Butte, America and I am proud to live in Billings, Montana. I’ll be 41 on Election Day. I am an attorney and recently entered private practice with the firm Netzer, Krautter, & Brown, P.C. Before that I served as a public defender with the State of Montana for 11 years. My work protected everyone’s rights under the Constitution. I have been involved with the Montana Legislature for a decade, using my public sector experience and knowledge of the criminal justice system to provide testimony and bill drafting assistance. Last year I used my advocacy to pass legislation to protect children from sexual assault and to cut red tape in state government. I can bring more positive change as your next state representative from Billings."

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "The most pressing issues in the upcoming session are addressing housing affordability, renewing Medicaid expansion, and reforming Montana State Hospital as well as our state’s mental health services. For housing, I support zoning reform, encouraging multi-family homes, and creative practices such as accessory dwelling units and community land trusts. Passing permanent Medicaid expansion is critical for a healthy and productive workforce. It’s also the right thing to do. The State Hospital is at serious risk of collapsing. As an attorney who has represented MSH patients, I’ll use my legal experience to draft legislation for building a new system of community-based mental health hospitals to provide patients the support they need."

        {
          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The 2023 Legislature fumbled an opportunity to stop the pandemic housing spike from spiking the property taxes of everyday Montanans, many on fixed incomes. Rather than adjust property taxes to keep homeowners from getting pinched, legislators cut income taxes for the wealthiest Montanans instead. Property taxes for railroad and mine owners have a cap as to how much their property taxes can increase each year, while homeowners do not. I support a wide range of tax reforms, such as expansion of the P-TAP program to the middle class, giving local governments more levers to generate revenue, and fixing the education funding formula to reduce dependence on mill levies."

          "answer": "The first critical priority is to pass permanent Medicaid expansion so that thousands upon thousands of Montanans are not denied needed health care. Health care reduces homelessness and improves public safety. I’ll support any reform that brings direct care to patients. DPHHS should not be denying health care for paperwork bungles or forcing rural residents to rely on phone calls to get critical care. I will also use my mental health experience and legal background to reform Montana’s broken mental heath care system, starting with Montana State Hospital and the involuntary commitment process. We can build mental health facilities that will keep patients in the community and plugged in to local resources."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "An educated community increases public safety and improves the quality of our workforce. Montana teachers are among the lowest paid in the nation. Teacher salaries must be increased. The school funding formula should be less reliant on local property taxes and mill levies. Education funding must be a reliable and consistent component of the state budget so schools know they will be getting the resources they need and can make long-term plans accordingly. I would oppose any measures that divert money from public schools. I also strongly support increased funding for early childhood education and quality daycare. Investments in early childhood education provide children with the best chance for a lifetime of success."

Our public schools also need proper funding and fair teacher salaries; I am committed to fully supporting them and resisting the shift of funds to private charter schools."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Our Montana property tax system has become increasingly and unconstitutionally hard on low-to-middle-income Montana residents while providing tax cuts to large corporations and the ultra-rich. The solution is straightforward: shift the tax burden back to the groups with the largest amount of resources and influence. Currently, residential properties are taxed based on market value, whereas industrial properties owned by refineries, railroads, and telecom companies are assessed differently. This discrepancy unfairly benefits these corporations, allowing them to contribute less than their fair share. Adjusting this imbalance will make the tax system more equitable, and replenish our state fund which supports essential services for Montanans."

          "question": "Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?",
          "answer": "Medicaid expansion, 90% funded by the federal government, has helped rural Montana hospitals and care facilities stay open through recent economic and pandemic related setbacks. We have invested in the expansion of services due to the cost savings and bolstered our economy with good paying jobs around the state. Medicaid expansion will end in 2025 unless our elected officials renew it. We need more long-term care facilities for mental health and the aging community through additional expenditures, which are made possible by the consistent annual influx of over $900million in federal funds. Patients benefit from remaining close to their families and communities, and our aging population will be needing a lot more care in the coming decades."

          "question": "Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "The funding challenges are connected to the shift of the tax burden from large corporations and the ultra-rich to workers and families who simply have less money to pull from. This has had a direct impact on resources available to fund schools. We must realign the tax system to ensure fairness. Additionally, removing the 3% cap on inflationary budget increases is crucial. This allows budget adjustments to accurately reflect actual inflation rates, which were as high as 8% in recent years. Furthermore, there's a pressing need to increase state funding for special education programs, and to stop the steal of school funding by siphoning money to private charter schools who are not required to educate students needing specific interventions."

I have owned a home in Red Lodge since 2000 and it became my permanent residence in 2013, after 20 years living, working and raising a family in Billings, MT. I previously had the honor of serving as the State Legislator (House and Senate) for 16 years for the Billings Heights. During my prior legislative tenure, I worked hard to listen to my constituents and focus on initiatives which promoted public education (lots of school age children in the Heights), fair taxation, small business and workforce development along with ensuring our community and residents had an effective and common sense voice"

I served on the Taxation Committees in the past, and know first hand that homeowner and small business property taxes need a rate reduction--an approach used in the past by legislature. Health care is critical to our community, as we've had several nursing home closures, and I will work on initiatives dealing with senior care, housing affordability, public education. The recent purge of Medicaid recipients will negatively impact health care for everyone, and jeopardize the financial viability for rural health care providers. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "As noted, during previous reappraisals, there was bipartisan support to reduce the property tax rates for homeowners and small business. This approach (although recommended in Nov, 2022) was ignored and resulted in over $200 million in permanent property tax increases for homeowners/small businesses. The blame on local governments is factually incorrect. We need to lower the rates and stop the ongoing shift of property taxes from large corporations to homeowners. Homeowners are now paying over 50% of property tax; we need to adjustthe appraisal process/valuation for other classes of property tax to ensure fairness, expand senior citizen exemptions (on property tax), include renters in our efforts and continue expanding housing."

          "answer": "First, the state needs to take quick meaningful action to requalify those eligible for Medicaid! The state leadership kicked off twice as many folks as projected; 70,000 were terminated due to the state's procedural problems. This means., forefeiting millions of dollars in Federal funding(our tax dollars). and raising health care costs for everyone. the DPHHS Director needs to be terminated. The legislature should pass legislation to renew and fund the state share of Medicaid Expansion and reinstate 12 month eligibility. The legislature, unfortunately, may need to \"micro manage\" this process; i.e. add temporary staff. We also need to expand health access in rural areas. "

          "answer": "School funding is complicated. However, coordination between OPI and local school districts (for budgeting) has suffered under the current OPI leadership and needs fixing. Next, we need to eliminate the charter school concept that is exempt from local control and stop siphong money from public schools. I would propose changes to the school funding formula to increase the state share. Also, the property tax system needs adjusting to ensure equalization. We need to provide resources for students so they can get workforce training or college credits while high school (other states do this) and consider putting more funding in programs rather than buildings.

Worked in non-profits, spent 30+ years in international satellite communications, built and sold two companies in Bozeman. Active in running community, schools, BridgerCare, business mentoring. Also lived (Hungary, Israel, South Africa) and worked abroad. Love our shared public lands (ultra runner).

(2) Property taxes: (a) The increase was a mistake that we should fix immediately (b) Montana residents should pay a lower tax than non-residents. (c) Renters should not be forgotten. (3) Growth and Affordable Housing: Allow local community input. (4) Medicaid Expansion: Brings medical care, money, and stabilizes the rural healthcare infrastructure. (5) Income tax fairness: We should use our success to invest in the present { bridges and roads} and in the future {public schools, wildlife protection, affordable housing}, instead of destabilizing our finances and shifting tax burden to lower wage earners, like the 2023 Legislature did."

          "answer": "(1) Previous legislatures fixed the property tax formula to be fair and not too different from last year’s. The 2023 Legislature didn’t do this, resulting in residential increases and cuts for large corporations. The responsibility lies with the Legislature, not the counties or local governments. Fixing the formula is easy and I’ll join others to make it happen. (2) I propose (a) we set the proportionality of the Residential tax component at a fixed percentage of the Total Property Tax to be Collected, and (b) tax “2nd homes” and “short-term rentals” owned by non-residents at a higher rate than residents pay. (3) Fix the tax system so we can secure funding for public schools from the General Fund. I will learn and offer solutions as I can."

Providing mental and physical health care services is not only the right thing to do, it also is cost-effective and will save taxpayers money in the long run. (2) The Legislature should support Medicaid Expansion that has provided needed health care coverage for working Montanans, helps families and small businesses that rely on these workers, especially important in rural parts of the state. (3) Support local non-profits to provide mental health and service support. (4) Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health programs.

(c) We should invest in better pay for teachers and school workforce, including using the state’s success to provide financing support for housing.

I have a Bachelor's in Criminal Justice Studies. My two decades of public service experience in emergency services has made me a hardworking, ethical, lifelong learner. I understand the importance of self-sacrifice, teamwork, and compromise to solve complex problems.

In Livingston, we have had multiple new taxes levied against our community. We need to ease this burden and ensure that money is being put towards basic, frontline services and not local government pet projects. By redirecting some of our marijuana tax, we can greatly improve the usability and safety of Montana’s roads by funding road materials, plow trucks, fire trucks, and police training. We have generated 113 million marijuana tax revenue, I think my plan is a realistic solution to a number of problems Montana faces. "

The Airbnb market and tax incentives for rentals should also be evaluated for potential solutions. The biggest contributor to this issue however is supply which has greatly increased property values. Our legislators managed to implement a short-term solution by giving the People their money back which I am thankful they did instead of going on a shopping spree with our tax dollars. The surplus we have now is a one-time deal and should not be used to create new ongoing debt. The financial bubble we are in has been going on too long and we need to prepare for the pop. "

          "answer": "The obvious answer is Medicaid Expansion, but the new problem is how Montana will pay for it. My understanding is our hospitals used temporary money to fund permanent debt, and now Montana has an over 120-million-dollar gun to its head. It’s the ultimate budgeting sin and now we must figure this out. I also see a need to restore local mental health services and child advocacy centers. Livingston lost both of those resources several years ago and it has had a substantial impact on our community. I just hope we can afford all of these programs with all the other competing needs of our State. "

Bring back timber, precious metal, and energy production so we can stop treating property owners as State piggy banks to shake whenever we want things. We need profitable natural resource projects that prioritize environmental and personal health. Having grown up in Libby, I understand the importance of environmental and health protections and bad actor accountability. So with those new dollars, I would prioritize K-12 and K-12 Trade Programs. Priority would also be given to schools that empower parents as the decision makers for their children’s education and teachers who teach children HOW to think, instead of WHAT to think. "

          "answer": "I was born in Pittsburgh PA in 1960, and lived there until I was 16. However as children we spent a lot of time in Dubois, WY, eventually moving to Dubois, where I finished High School. I then went to college in Bozeman MT at MSU in 1978, and have lived in Montana ever since. Currently my wife Traci and I live in Park county on Bozeman Pass, where we have raised our family, and lived for over 40 Years. I am currently a retired teacher of over 30 years, having taught for the Livingston School Dist., and MSU. I have been very active In Livingston & Park Co., and feel that I have a strong relationship and understanding of our diverse community. Being a teacher and lifelong learner I have a lot of experience and interest in a variety of topics"

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "There are going to many pressing issues as we enter the 2025 session. Medicaid expansion/admin, property taxes, affordable housing, mental health, and education just to name a few. Medicaid expansion in MT sunsets in 2025, so it is imperative that the state reenrolls in that, and that we find better methods of administering access to it for Montanans that need it. We also must find more solutions to affordable housing besides reducing regulations, which many now oppose. We need to look at tax incentives for builders, developers, landlords, and towns that create truly affordable housing. I will also support sustainable solutions to finding property tax relief for many MT’s, part of which includes making sure corporations pay their share. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The GOP controlled state legislature and Governor failed to sustainably address the expected rise in property taxes, resulting in MT residents paying on average 21% more than they were paying. It was well known in the legislature that the short term $675 tax rebates implemented during the session were not a long term solution, and did little to relieve the cost & anxiety Montana property owners are experiencing. Certain proposals were put forth last session that did offer tax relief for MT's but were ignored. If elected I will represent the people of Montana in finding long term solutions to restructuring our property tax system, providing relief for those that need it, while ensuring the wealthy, and big corporations pay their fair share."

          "answer": "Medicaid Expansion in MT sunsets in 2025. It is very important that the legislature re-enrolls in that program, so as a state we can afford the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans. This is also important so that mental & healthcare providers can afford to offer their services. In 2023 after the COVID era all states had to re-align their Medicaid enrollment. In MT the Governor has administered a deeply flawed process leading to over 120,000 Montanans to lose services. Some numbers: 70,000 were due to administrative reasons, Nearly 36,000 children have had their coverage terminated, 13,000 Native folks coverage terminated, including over4,000 Native children, over 7,600 seniors kicked off their insurance.

          "answer": "School funding is very complicated. Revenue comes from many sources: city, county, state, and federal, and is allocated in various ways. Currently the funding formula used by the state is antiquated, and limiting, and needs addressed. Whatever the case, it is duly noted that we need to invest more in our youth, and that the legislature really needs to look at the current formula, and actively find solutions. Being an educator for 30+ years this is an issue dear to my heart, and I look forward to working hard to find meaningful solutions. Describing possible solutions with a 750-character limit is impossible, however stating that I am devoted and dedicated to our educational systems and the youth they serve is easy!"

It has increased access to quality healthcare, leading to better health, employment and financial outcomes for Montanans. It brings millions of federal dollars into Montana, keeps our rural hospitals afloat, and creates many good paying Montana jobs. It helps children receive consistent healthcare so that problems are discovered and treated early, and it improves school readiness. It saves money by reducing emergency room visits, leaving emergency rooms available to those in acute need. I have continually fought for accessible health care for working Montanans, such as HB850 which I sponsored last session to boost medicaid coverage for Montana children."

          "answer": "We must restore property tax fairness for Montana homeowners. Last session, the Republican supermajority's policies and subsequent action by the Governor caused property taxes to skyrocket, while taxes for corporations, mines, utilities, and the wealthiest Montanans decreased. I introduced HB253 which sought to prevent these extreme increases by allowing state mills to \"float,\" so that when property values increase, mills decrease and tax bills remain relatively constant. My bill also sought to create a homestead exemption for those living in their homes, shifting the burden back to corporations and second home owners. I also supported other similar Democratic proposals. I will continue to fight for property tax fairness for homeowners. "

          "answer": "The most critical action needed is extending medicaid expansion. We must also address Republican policies which have stripped 120,000 Montanans of their health care, including 30,000 children, mostly for technical red tape reasons. To prevent this in the future, I will seek to restore \"continuous eligibility\" which was Montana policy until the Governor ended it. I sought to create continuous eligibility for children last session, which failed by one vote, so I will try again. I also introduced HB17, which sought to create Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, to greatly expand access to mental health care. That policy is going forward and we will hopefully see results in the not too distant future. "

We must end the Republican policies of siphoning money from our public schools to unaccountable private and religious schools.

          "answer": "I was born in the old Bozeman hospital and grew up in 4 corners. I am 49 and live in Big Sky, MT. I am an attorney and own my own business. I have a B.A. in philosophy and psychology. I graduated from the University of Montana's School of Law in 2002 with my J.D., with honors. I specialize in contract law and litigation.\n\nMy specialty is representing owner’s associations, which is much like the legislature. I help HOAs redraft their governing documents so that their rules actually address the needs of the community, work with government agencies on infrastructure and act as a mediator between neighbors. I will use my skills as a drafter to draft common sense laws and as a negotiator to get them passed into law."

          "answer": "Property taxes and affordable housing are what people want to discuss with me. I address property taxes in another question.\n\nBig Sky has a resort tax, which is partially used to fund our Community Housing Trust. Our Trust has created 52 affordable, owner-occupied condominiums, moved 111 short-term rentals into long-term, local housing, ensured seven homes will always house local workers and this summer, and will complete 25 low-income apartments for locals. The Governor’s task force identified subsidies as something that needs to be studied. I would suggest that we should look at using the bed tax, which mainly funds advertising Montana, to go to our local communities for programs like Big Sky’s Trust. "

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift in the tax burden, from utilities and industries to private landowners. While residential taxes rose 30% in Gallatin County, Montana Rail Link’s share dropped 22%. It used to be that utilities and industry shared a larger share of the tax pie. I believe that we have tipped the scales too much in their favor. We must move the needle back so industry can make a profit, but not on the backs of the people."

          "question": "Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?",
          "answer": "The legislature needs to permanently fund Medicaid Expansion (or as I call it, closing the coverage gap.) The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at University of Montana has consistently found that “Medicaid expansion increases health insurance coverage and healthcare access, improving individuals’ health and household’s financial health while creating thousands of jobs and millions in income for Montanans throughout the economy.” This program provides 100,000 Montanans health insurance. That’s about 10% of our population. It is a win win for everyone and ensures that our Federal tax dollars come home to Montana as 90% of the funding is Federal dollars."

          "question": "Many education leaders are concerned that the state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students. What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Education funding formulas are incredibly complex and it is hard to make changes to them without unintended consequences. However, I believe that we need to tackle this so that schools receive funding that is adjusted for median area income and cost. Right now, there are no adjustments for the actual costs of materials, goods and for a living wage for staff. That means a starting teacher in Miles City may be paid the same amount as one in Big Sky or West Yellowstone. This simply is not equitable nor sustainable. At the same time, we need to ensure that rural schools are able to use their funding in a manner that best suits them, like making funds available to build housing for their teachers."

I am the executive director of a conservation nonprofit called the Mountain Mamas, who focus on elevating women's voices regarding conservation issues. I also co-own a marketing firm that assists in communications efforts for entities like the City of Bozeman, Headwaters Economics, Madison Valley Bank, United States Forest Service, and many more. For many years, I was a mountaineering guide, and traveled the world extensively climbing and skiing. For the past 15 years, I've devoted my career to influencing federal and state legislation."

Gianforte is ignoring the will of the voters, and that must be rectified. Additionally, threats and targeted legislation that would alter or change our Montana constitution - especially women's ability to care for our bodies as we see fit - are very concerning. Stomping down efforts and proposed legislation that would compromise women's access to healthcare must be stopped, and I would absolutely support any legislation that would permanently support a woman's right to choose and provide an insurance policy to our state constitution. Additionally, we must fund, support, and protect our public schools."

          "answer": "The increase in property taxes has effected nearly every homeowner in Montana, apparently except for Gov.

I would propose steeper taxes on second and third homeowners, as well as ensure large businesses are paying their fair share. Additionally, some sales tax options on an individual city or county scale basis could be explored, perhaps for non-essential items (so excluding food, healthcare items, etc.) Asking residential homeowners to bear the brunt of the tax burden is simple not fair, or tenable for hard-working Montanans."

Medicare expansion is vital to help support ALL Montanans, especially those that fall in the cracks of the income brackets in the Health Care Marketplace. The legislature MUST expand healthcare access for all, and especially provide comprehensive mental health support and access. I was able to tour the Community Health Partners site in Bozeman, and was blown away with the mental, dental, and physical health services they provide. These facilities are needed in more places across Montana, and we must work to help fund efforts to grow access to quality care, at a low-to-free cost. "

We have incredible renewable energy resources. We need legislative leadership to enact policies to hasten and facilitate the renewable energy bonanza in Montana. \n\nFairer taxation - I support relying more on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund.\n\nOther pressing issues below."

I support creating additional income tax brackets for those making over approximately $125,000 to offset lowering the property rate for in-state primary residence homeowners. I also support creating a separate increased rate for out-of-state property owners, and taxing corporate and industrial property owners to levels somewhere between 1994 and now."

And, quite frankly, this states’ most important investment is our children and their education; artificial limits on that investment are short-sighted.\nFurther, we have the lowest starting salary for teachers of any state in the nation. Embarrassing. Given Montana’s cost of living, particularly housing, we should have some of the nation’s highest starting salaries our educators. It is paramount in the next legislative session to work toward this goal.\n"

But funding has slipped over time, and without renewed investment, our children’s futures are at risk. To begin with, we cannot continue as the lowest paying state in the nation in terms of salaries for new teachers.\nEnergy: We must ensure reasonably priced, responsibly-sourced energy production.

We have a significant surplus at the moment. Let’s put aside some of it specifically to serve schools. The interest would make a real difference in terms of maintaining programs and paying teachers.\n3. Localities should be allowed more room for taxing tourists.

          "answer": "I answered this question partially in number three. But here is more:\n\nThe legislature uses a funding formula that provides schools with funding based on 3% inflationary increases per year. But the actual inflation rate has been much higher. For example, in 2022, it was 8%. In 2023, it was 4.1%. Over time, this discrepancy means shrinking support for our schools, shrinking support that compounds. We need to have our funding relate to actual on-the-ground cost increases. \n\nAlso, the school funding formula doesn’t adjust for cost of living challenges. Teachers need more money to live in Bozeman than they need in small rural communities, for instance. We need to find a way to adjust funding for schools according to cost of living. \n"

          "answer": "The state has the constitutional responsibility to “appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property” (Article VIII, Sect. 3). Property taxes skyrocketed because values spiked, but the tax rates weren’t equalized during the 2023 legislative session. Since the property values increased and tax rates stayed the same, tax bills increased dramatically. I would support re-equalizing property tax rates to rebalance how much homeowners are charged without reducing the revenue collected by the state. Additionally, it is important for the state to consider the needs of the communities and factors like the cost of living when distributing funding to schools and local governments."

          "answer": "Before considering additional steps, we need to ensure that the state maintains the current support for lower-income Montanans by renewing Medicaid expansion, which is scheduled to sunset in 2025. The legislature should remove the sunset from Medicaid expansion because it is a program that has proven to bolster local economies, support healthcare providers, and keep Montanans healthier than they would be without it. Additionally, our state needs to ensure that Medicaid adequately reimburses providers for the services provided so that providers can stay open. Continued investment in our healthcare system that allows for accessible meaningful mental and physical healthcare services is essential."

          "answer": "Education leaders are correct. The current cap on annual inflationary increases is lower than the inflation rate. I support adjusting the funding formula to keep up with inflation and ensuring that our teachers receive competitive wages that allow them to live in the communities where they teach. \nPublic education is not just a policy issue for me-it's personal. I wouldn't have had the opportunities I've had in life without the public education system in our state. I am dedicated to supporting policies that guarantee public funding is directed towards public schools, that families can access affordable early childhood education, and that post-secondary education remains accessible to residents while supporting a sustainable labor force."

Working with government contracts in Montana and Wyoming, and the many business realities including hiring and paying employees has given me a strong education in political climates and business issues.

State law needs to be more explicit in remedies such as recall guidelines and bonding requirements for when our elected officials act outside of their enumerated powers or fail to fulfill their duties of office. Transparency in the law-making process and financial expenditures is needed to illuminate wasteful spending; mandated online annual reporting is needed. Property tax increases need to be capped to no more than 10% in any one year and property tax relief given to the elderly on fixed incomes."

          "answer": "Taxation should never be separated from expenditures. Every school and state department should post online their current request for funding, their current funding sources and amounts and their past three years of expenditures. Each department should have a published statement on what their main function is; expenditures outside of the main focus would then become obvious as financials are also published.

          "answer": "The current health-care system in America is broken and in need of critical scrutiny. The unhealthy monetization of disease treatments needs to be abolished. Freedom to choose medical care should be enhanced and barriers to innovative healthcare delivery removed such as obstacles to subscription services by family doctors. Fraud in the Medicare system needs to be aggressively prosecuted as well as price gouging by pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies. The best outcome for health delivery is to remove third parties that stand between the health care provider and the patient.  "

          "answer": "Education delivery has not kept up with technology and needs to be rethought. Parents consistently support more choice in education opportunities such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, vocational and public schools. Public schools may better serve as education centers that parents can choose what their child needs from a variety of services. Better use of current facilities to serve growing student population should be considered. Allowing for schools to hire teachers from professional backgrounds without teaching certificates would help alleviate teacher shortages. Efficiencies may be gained by regulatory relief on required administrative positions. "

The legislature along with the governor need to use the tools at our disposal to adjust tax rates so corporations pay their share. Education funding is a disaster. We need to include a cost of living allowance into our formula for districts that are in high cost of living communities in Montana.

I would support a homestead exemption so primary homes are taxed at a lower rate. I would also push to bring the tax rate for high income earners back up to the level it was before the 2023 session.

          "answer": "I believe that we are not currently funding education as our constitution demands. The concept of quality education has been manipulated to leave us with a system that is struggling to meet the basic needs of our students. The cost of living in MT has changed over the years and the difference in cost of living across the state is now disparate. The school funding formula has no way to account for that and it is past time to do so. In addition, the cap on inflationary increase for school funding has effectively caused education funding to fall farther and farther behind! We must fix both of these problems in the next session."

Support for mental health is critical. Law enforcement and educators are both impacted by the need for these services. We need to support our rural hospitals through Medicaid Expansion which is vital to the long term stability of our small hospitals and their employees. We have a looming teacher shortage that we should plan for now and we have an affordable housing crisis. We can't keep good teachers or law enforcement if they can't afford to live in our communities. Resource issues critical, such as the infringement of long held private water rights by new claimants.

          "answer": "There are solutions to rising property tax. Currently, short term rentals are subject to the same tax as residential and long-term rentals and second homes are also taxed at the same rate as primary residences, two areas to consider. The Legislature should focus on working within the tax classes to more accurately determine who the rates are intended for. This would help achieve a fairer balance between classes. Property tax rates could be frozen; it makes little sense for someone who has owned a residence for 30 years, to be taxed on the appreciated value, when they haven't realized the gain. The tax could be changed when the residence is sold. And, spending matters. We also need to remember, each county has its own unique circumstance. "

We need to work on a improving our mental health care system which would support law enforcement. Our jails are not designed treat mental health and our communities need services to support those that are in need. In the long term, adequate services will be more cost effective and take pressure off law enforcement and first responders. Montana's Medicaid Expansion funds major investment addressing the behavioral health crisis in our State which is critical. "

Property values have gone up but in many areas the assessed value is too high. Also, we must keep our spending in check and keep the budget with little to no growth. This will allow the state to drop some of the mill rates that are applied statewide. Also, the cities are going to have to work on their budgets, this is where a lot of the property tax money is going. There are laws that can be passed to curtail some of the rapid growth for certain parts of the population, we can put a cap on property assessment growth on certain age groups."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The property assessment process needs to be reformed. In many cases the values were way over actual market value. Also, once the budget is looked and and curtailed wherever possible we can lower some of the mill rates that are state wide. Also, there can be some caps on rapid increases in market value to certain segments of the population. For example, a retired couple that has lived in a hosue for 30 years could have a max allowable increase (on a percentage basis) per assessment period."

          "answer": "Since this is not a constitutionally prescribed job of the state government much of this is dependent on budget and available money. Although the money spent on these programs usually ends up saving the state money in certain instances because it oftens falls on law enforcement. We have almost completely eliminated state run mental facilities. We must bring those back for the safety of people struggling with mental health issues and the safety of the communities. In dealing with physical health, the state should promote a healthy lifestyle with incentives and credits on health care to encourage people to live healthier lives.  "

I believe that our school systems are adequately funded. Many schools have a hard time with budgeting and cannot operate withing their means.

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",
          "answer": "I was born in Sandpoint ID and my Parents lived in Noxon MT. I am 68 old and semi-retired.. I have the time necessary to be an effective Representative. I was on the Dillon City Council for four years and Mayor for 8 years. I have hands on knowledge of how government works. I own a small Business in Dillon and see the effect taxes and regulations have on businesses. I have a PhD in Physics. My education has taught me how to understand data presented to me in various forms. My life experiences has given me common sense and taught me to listen to other persons' point of view. By working together you often get the best end result."

          "question": "What do you consider to be the most pressing issues facing Montana heading into the 2025 session and what legislation would you propose and/or support to address these issues?",
          "answer": "I would like to keep Montana values and preserve the way of life I knew growing up in Montana. I know that the Montana population is growing but this growth needs to be controlled so that Montana does not become another California. I have seen a lot of changes in Montana and not all of them are positive."

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services such as schools, counties and city/town programs but are calculated through a system set by the Legislature. What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Tax payers are not and should not be a bottomless purse. Property taxes are very inequitable and discriminatory how they are calculated. This tax must be changed if not completely removed. Keeping high property taxes makes it so you never own your property and the Government can tax you out of your home. Finding a solution to this problem will be difficult and I am willing to work with all legislators to find a solution to this problem."
        },

          "question": "Considering the state’s role in mental and physical health care services, especially in helping cover the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans, what additional steps, if any, do you believe the Legislature should take to enhance health care access and promote Montanans’ health?",
          "answer": "Instead of figuring out a way to pay for high Medical and Mental health costs, Government should be looking for more cost effective methods of providing the services. Funding is not unlimited so how to get the most for what we have has to be looked at. Affordable health care is a problem all over the United States and what other States are doing needs to be studied. Government has thrown tax payers money at the problem for years without looking for a way to be more cost effective."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Again as in Health care the current plan is to “find” more money for the Schools. In reviewing my property tax a majority of the taxes are for the Schools and that is still not enough. Ideas need to be explored on how to educate K-12 students. I know the world has changed but we are busing children four or five blocks to school. How much is that costing the taxpayers in equipment, fuel, and labor? Could neighborhoods find volunteers to walk with the kids to school? This would save some of the busing costs."

I am the former owner-manager of Madison Lumber Company in Ennis and am currently employed as a Contracts Administrator in the oil and gas industry.\nI am a hard working farm kid, and have learned through business and community activism the importance of community. I can communicate effectively across the political spectrum.\nI was selected as an intern at Montana's Constitutional Convention. I have lobbied the Montana Legislature for the Montana Women's Lobby, the Montana Building Industry Association and the Montana Ambassadors. I understand the legislative process.\n"

There also must be a cap on the percent allowable for appraisal increases in an annual cycle.\nOur ability to make personal health care decisions is under attack. I will defend the Right to Privacy as afforded to us by the Montana Constitution.\nThe influx of out of state residences has inflated housing costs beyond the means of average Montanans. Affordable Housing is a legislative priority. I propose incentives for affordable housing projects and employer sponsored housing. I also propose fees on new construction assessed proportional to the value with such fees supporting incentives and subsidies"

Expansion of health coverage, whether public or private, to include mental health services is critical for mitigation and prevention of accompanying issues, addiction, partner or child abuse, and a host of personal and community risks.\nI believe that health care is a human right, and although I support a single payer health care plan not tied to employment, that is an issue for the US Congress.

          "answer": "The school funding formulas must include allowances for personnel cost of living increases and service costs such as fuel and facility maintenance., and proposals for adjustment should be considered and adopted. I would support a review of components included in mill value establishment.\nCoal tax and marijuana fees are earmarked for education and community infrastructure. I would oppose diverting earmarked educational revenue sources to the general fund or used for government agency operations.\nAssuring our children receive a quality education is a priority for the Montana Legislature. Public schools are the lifeblood of our communities. I will support policies which enhance our schools and oppose policies which detract."

We need to bring accountability to government agencies, audit their waste and fraud and cut budgets and wasteful programs to lower our State budget to a sustainable level. We need a government that spends based on what they have, not that spends wastefully and then gives us the bill."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "I would reevaluate what is actually \"essential\" to start with. Next I'd cut out waste by having an outside auditor audit every government agency and pay them with a percentage of the fraud or waste they uncover. Montana took in $2.1 Billion in property taxes in 2023 but spent $1.97BILLION dollars on \"confidential payments\" alone! We need accountability, to cut waste and in doing so we'll lower our budget and taxes accordingly."

          "answer": "Obamacare was a mess to start with. I don't believe government should be involved in the Dr. patient relationship. The Legislature could improve Montana's healthcare by getting the government out of it. There were and always will be assistance programs for indigent people that will help cover medical bills. Bringing big government in to manage it just doesn't work. If it did everyone would go to the VA hospitals."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Again, audits would be a huge money saver. Better management of State lands would also be a help to that funding. The Mt Prison in Deer Lodge owns 30,000 acres. The Prison complex is roughly 30 acres. Much of that 30k acres is farmland. Montanans are paying to manage that land when it could be leased to private entities and could realize a profit for the State.  Government needs oversight by the public and audits to ensure that waste and fraud are limited.   "

How do these things and your other life experiences qualify you to be an effective legislator?",
          "answer": "I was born in Rapid City, SD. I will be 57 by election day. I have lived in Helena since 2005 and worked in Environmental Consulting for 25 years. I am not currently employed. I have a M.S. in ecology and a B.A. in biology. My career emphasized human health risk assessment, where I determined risks from exposure to contaminants such as arsenic, lead and uranium. An understanding of environmental toxicology has made me an advocate for clean water sources, especially for our children in public schools. \n\nI also worked for the House of Representatives in the legislative session last year. That experience inspired me to run for office and join our citizen legislature. I would like to be a thoughtful advocate for the voters in my district."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Property taxes are necessarily high in Montana because we are one of a handful of states that do not have a statewide sales tax. (We do have “resort tax” in a few areas of the state.) Most states rely heavily on sales tax, which is shared across all consumers, as opposed to property tax which is only levied on property owners. We are leaving a lot of revenue on the table by not having a statewide sales tax that would be collected on not only our 1.1 million residents but also our 12 million nonresident visitors. I think we should evaluate the pros and cons of a statewide sales tax."

          "answer": "I am big believer in cancer screenings, such as mammograms, pap smears, prostate screenings and colonoscopies. Many people have access to these screenings under their insurance, often for no charge, and do not choose to utilize them. We need to spread the word on the importance of wellness checks and the ability to identify and treat a disease early."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "One of the tricky issues to be addressed on school funding is the fact that the cost to educate a student varies across the state, but the formula allocates the same amount for each student. Determining the school districts that need more support and those that can afford a lower dollar amount per student would be helpful for the next legislative session where the decennial school funding formulas will be reviewed and revised."

          "answer": "Undoubtedly, the most pressing and consequential issue facing the 2025 Montana Legislature is the conclusion of Medicaid Expansion and the dire need for it to be renewed. Not only does Medicaid Expansion allow hundreds of thousands of Montanas security regarding their health insurance, it also provides tens of thousands of Montana kids access to pediatric care. Medicaid also ensures that rural hospitals across Montana are able to keep their doors open to provide lifesaving care. I was working in the Montana Legislature in 2019 when Medicaid Expansion was first passed -- and let me assure you, it was not passed easily. It required political acumen in order to secure the vote of moderate republicans and an acute understanding of the process. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "To lower taxes on residential property, the Legislature should rebalance the property tax system by making sure corporations and businesses pay a fairer share of the property tax burden. One way to do this would be to provide a \"homestead exemption\" for individual property owners. This would exempt some part of the homeowner’s market value from taxation, lowering the residential property tax burden for homeowners and increasing the costs that corporations and businesses have to pay.

          "answer": "I have always firmly believed that taking care of people is the single most important role of our government. That is, in fact, why I was drawn to this work in the first place. For a while now, our government has not been working for most people, especially our lower-income friends and neighbors.

          "answer": "Most, if not all, public schools in our state are massively underfunded. In order to better and more sustainably fund our public schools, I would start with revising our tax structure to place more responsibility on the wealthiest Montanans and the multi-million dollar corporations doing business in our state. Additionally, I would restructure how recreational marijuana tax is being distributed within our counties – taxing higher and sending more to our public schools. Further, I would have a much larger discussion about how the hundred million dollars received annually by the Montana Lottery is being allocated out of the general fund. "

We have a moral and constitutional imperative to invest in our children's education, and the failure to do so will also undermine economic growth and opportunity. The next Legislature must bolster our investment in Montana's children."

          "answer": "Montana families are understandably concerned about the drastic increase in their residential property taxes which have substantially outpaced inflation. However, we must recognize that property taxes are a critical source of investment in public education and many other public goods. Article VIII of the Montana Constitution diagnoses the problem and compels the solution: \"The state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law.\" Our current system places an unfair burden on residential property owners. The next Legislature must ensure that we equalize residential home valuations with corporate and other business property classes."

          "answer": "The Montana Legislature joined 41 other states in 2015 to expand Medicaid coverage, which has enabled many Montanans in low-income jobs or part-time work due to disabilities to afford healthcare. By providing access to mental and physical healthcare services, more Montana children were able to attend school and learn while more people were able to continue working to support their families. Furthermore, the vast majority of the costs are paid for by the federal government. Investing in the health of our low-income children and families is not only a moral imperative, but a widely acclaimed policy to bolster our economy and reduce state expenditures. The next Legislature must renew Medicaid expansion."

          "answer": "Public school districts across Montana are facing growing budget deficits while doing their best to support and educate our children, an increasing number of whom are struggling with poverty, isolation, and pandemic related learning loss. We must ensure that our state funding formula is addressing the growing needs of our students while keeping pace with the increasing costs of meeting their needs. Article X of the Montana Constitution provides that \"Equality of educational opportunity is guaranteed to each person of the state.\" Our funding formula must therefore acknowledge that some students will need more services than others to reach their full potential and provide resources accordingly to the public schools that serve them."

Growing up I was raised not only by my parents, but by this community. I am running for re-election because I want to continue to give back to my community. As a public servant my entire career, I am an effective problem solver who can find common ground for solutions to the challenges facing Helena and Montana. \nAs I seek re-election, I'm eager to continue leveraging my passion, experience, and collaborative spirit to serve the people of Montana."

I will propose legislation to enhance public school funding, reduce class sizes, and expand teacher training. Additionally, we must address the housing crisis by incentivizing affordable housing construction and supporting tenants' rights. Furthermore, I advocate for broader Medicaid eligibility, consumer protections, and reduced prescription costs to ensure comprehensive healthcare. Let's unite to enact bold policies for a brighter future."

          "answer": "\nI recognize the strain of escalating residential property taxes, especially for fixed-income families and seniors in Montana. While vital for funding local services, our tax system must be fair. Our current regressive property tax system disproportionately affects working families. I propose shifting the tax burden from residential homeowners by increasing taxes on other property classifications. This would bolster the local economy, benefiting all Montanans.

          "answer": "I'm committed to tackling the critical issues facing Montanans, starting with accessible healthcare. No one should forego medical care due to financial constraints. I'll push for policies ensuring quality healthcare for all, regardless of income. Extending Medicaid beyond 2025 is crucial, especially for vulnerable populations like children. We must address healthcare access disparities by investing in preventive care, telehealth, and rural healthcare. Healthcare is a basic right, and I'll tirelessly advocate for its accessibility to every Montanan, building a system that uplifts our communities."

          "answer": "I'm deeply dedicated to ensuring every child in Montana receives a top-notch education, from pre-K through college. Our current school funding formula falls short, hindering schools from keeping up with rising costs. Last session, I proposed removing the cap on inflation adjustments to enable schools to budget more effectively. Moreover, I will advocate for a thorough review and reform of the funding formula to better cater to student needs. Increasing state investment in education is vital, including funding for smaller class sizes, teacher training, and technology access. Our public schools are the bedrock of our society, and it's imperative we prioritize their funding for all children's benefit, regardless of background."

My military background instilled leadership, teamwork, and justice principles. With roles in bail agent associations and a computer science education, I'm ready to tackle Montana's challenges. I aim to foster economic growth, advocate for educational freedom, and ensure community safety and prosperity. Campaigning for the Montana legislature, my vision is a state thriving on liberty, opportunity, and justice. My diverse experience fuels my commitment to principled governance, industry improvement, and cross-sector cooperation. I'm prepared to represent Montanans with integrity and vision."

I plan to propose legislation fostering a business-friendly environment to stimulate job growth and attract investments. Recognizing the pivotal role of education in shaping our future, I'll advocate for policies enhancing school choice, empowering parents, and promoting vocational training to meet our workforce needs. Additionally, to bolster public safety, I'll support measures strengthening law enforcement resources and revising bail laws to balance justice with community safety. My focus will be on pragmatic solutions to ensure Montana's prosperity, educational excellence, and a secure, just society."

My approach includes expanding the tax base through economic growth and diversification, reducing reliance on property taxes. I advocate for a comprehensive review of current tax exemptions and incentives, ensuring they're effective and equitable. Additionally, I propose increasing efficiency in local government spending and exploring alternative revenue sources, such as tourism-related taxes, which capitalize on Montana's natural attractions without disproportionately impacting residents.

Supporting legislation that expands Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) will empower Montanans with more direct control over their healthcare expenses. Streamlining regulations to facilitate quicker introduction of services and encouraging private sector solutions to increase efficiency in healthcare delivery are essential.

Ensuring sustainable funding for pre-K–12, higher education, and vocational programs is vital. I propose assessing and optimizing current spending, and exploring public-private partnerships to enhance funding.

          "answer": "The legislature needs to step in and maintain the Medicaid program in DPHHS that was purposefully undermined. Upwards of 100,000 Montanans have been kicked off. The Governor paid $2m for a contractor to make recommendations to improve the workplace at the State Hospital. Very few recommendations have been implemented to improve the situation. DPHHS has not been paying local community healthcare providers for both healthcare and mental health services already provided, delaying the payments so community providers are being forced to close their doors. Protecting these community-based services should be a top priority for the legislature. We have worked for years to place services in local areas to improve access and need to keep them."

          "answer": "The Montana Legislature must increase state funding of schools and address the needs of both rural and urban schools in the new funding formula. The percent of state funding of schools has gone down over the last many years which requires local mill levies to increase dramatically just to maintain current levels of programs. Investing in a sustainable funding mechanism will allow schools to provide quality educational experiences to kids all over Montana. We also need to pay our teachers better, keeping our Montana educated teachers here rather than losing them to other states. A statewide teacher salary schedule could address this issue."

I would propose or support a long term solution to balance the method in which mills are determined and ensure that if a surplus occurs due to property tax revenue, the money is returned to all property owners.

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "To address this issue, I have noted possible solutions steps above. Additionally, the Legislature needs to redetermine school funding mechanisms and take into consideration technology and safety/security needs that are ever changing. Local municipalities also need to find ways to be more fiscally conservative to utilize local taxes more responsibly.

I proudly served on the State Rehabilitation Council that provided insight and guidance to the state and federal funding sources to help those with disabilities find and secure educational and workforce development programs that fit their long-term needs for independent living. The Voc Rehab programs are great examples of collaborative and life changing assistance with strong and measurable goals and outcomes.

          "answer": "The legislature can ensure that all families and students have adequate funding by focusing on schools, districts, teachers, and programs with strong outcomes and not rewarding those with weak and low performing outcomes. Additionally, the funding formula should take into account rapidly changing programs like Career and Technical Education (CTE), technology in the classroom and schools, and school safety and security. The annual increases should also more closely align, but not always follow, inflation. "

          "answer": "The system is set by Legislature but the system is created with input from many stakeholders. It has been many years since the manner in which property taxes are calculated, has seen significant reform. \nI've lived in Montana all of my life and I believe during the last 7-10 years, our landscape, houses and rural lands has changed the most drastically. Due to increased demand to live in the 406 area code, real estate prices have driven up values and market values are what drive the equation. It is time to change the equation. It is past time to change the equation. Voters in my district were hurting before the market drove up the property taxes. In 2023 session, we increased funds for tax relief and expanded eligibility for the programs. "

          "answer": "In my three sessions, I feel as if we have gained ground each session in addressing the needs of those needing mental and physical health care services. Is it ever \"enough\" ? Unfortunately no, but the Legislature will continue work on this issue, as we do all others. In 2015, the Legislature passed the HELP Act (Medicaid Expansion), and in 2019, passed the continuation of Medicaid Expansion. It will be on the Agenda again this session. The big push will be to either renew or delete the sunset. Also added in 2019 were work requirements and other measures to help prevent fraud. I think Medicaid Expansion does allow lower-income people to receive health care access."

I moved to Helena to take a job with the Montana Department of Revenue where I worked as the Department's primary property tax attorney until 2017. I interpreted existing laws, worked with the Legislature to draft proposed laws, and worked with stakeholders to improve Montana's property tax system. I became the Department's Chief Administrative Law Judge in 2017 where I heard and ruled on challenges brought against the Department by taxpayers. I retired in 2023.

I will also work to ensure continued access to public lands for recreational purposes, and to increase access where possible. Access to housing and healthcare must be addressed, as many Montanans cannot afford either. I would support legislation to address these issues.

Owners of residential property and Main Street business bear an excessive tax burden under the current system, and something needs to be done. However, it’s imperative we fund our local programs and schools. Current laws relating to the calculation of school mills need to be revisited. As a member of the Legislature, I would support a review of historic school financing needs, and work with school leaders, parents, and local governments to determine likely future needs. Once the scope of need is established, I would support legislation that would attempt to fund those needs by requiring corporations and non-resident property owners to bear a fair portion of our residents' property tax liabilities."

Access to proper health care reduces the overall cost to state and local governments by assisting individuals in becoming more engaged and productive members of their communities. The Legislature should strive to better serve its rural communities through programs designed to establish clinics, mobile health care, and telehealth providers in our rural areas. Our lawmakers should also work to expand services currently provided to low-income and at-risk citizens, and to develop a more workable process for determining and redetermining Medicaid eligibility."

          "answer": "Montana’s Constitutional goal is to establish an education system that will “develop the full educational potential of each person” and to fund the State’s share of that system in an equitable manner. Montana’s school funding process is complex, and I would work with experts from across the state to determine whether that funding process is viable or if new or additional funding is required. The Legislature’s first goal should be to support its public school system rather than to divert tax dollars to privatize education. Montana’s future is in the hands of our children and young adults, and I believe it is imperative that we provide adequate educational opportunities to ensure they become effective stewards of that future."

This will give us the chance to most effectively address pressing issues, such as providing property tax relief, increasing the supply of attainable housing for our workforce, revamping our mental health system, and bringing innovation into our public schools. I will be working with other legislators to find solutions to these and other challenges that face Montanans."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": " Property taxes exclusively go toward funding schools, cities, and counties. So cutting local spending would reduce taxes but also would likely cause a reduction in services. Without spending cuts, reducing tax rates shifts the tax burden between property classes (e.g., from residential to agricultural and commercial) or to income tax payers. I am presently one of six legislators serving on Governor Gianforte’s property tax task force, which is carefully weighing several options. Among the most promising is a homestead exemption for a Montana resident’s primary home. Another is expanding current safety net programs for fixed income homeowners. "

          "answer": "The legislature in 2025 will consider reauthorization of the Montana HELP Act. Here are facts that will influence my position on this action: Most enrollees work (72%), while 23% are disabled, caretakers, or students. About 60% of Montana businesses have employees enrolled in the program. The financial viability of rural healthcare facilities depends on Medicaid funding; otherwise, they must provide uncompensated care to the poor. The program does not increase funding of abortion because poor women are already eligible for Traditional Medicaid—the same program that covers the elderly. Enrollment decreases when the economy improves. Any effective program must include work requirements."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "The current school funding formula was crafted to meet the state's constitutional obligation to provide adequate and equitable funding of Montana's public schools. It achieves that objective. That said, it will undergo its next decennial study immediately after the 2025 session comes to a close. This will provide us the opportunity for a thorough and thoughtful update of the formula. One thing that I plan to work on for the 2025 session is relooking the inflation adjustment that is in the formula. In the meantime, the legislature has implemented and is expanding programs to expand career and technical education programs, to encourage innovation in our public schools, and to increase starting pay for new teachers.

This would decrease the portion of property taxes paid by Montanans and shift some of the burden to out-of-state residents.

My board service has included the United Way, Partnership Health, Community Medical Center the YMCA and Missoula Economic Partnership.

          "answer": "The most pressing issue facing the 2025 legislature is the reauthorization of Montana's Medicaid program. The program not only serves Montanans in need, including children and seniors, but also sustains many of our small rural hospitals. Without reauthorization of the program, many of those hospitals will not be financially sustainable, creating additional barriers to healthcare for thousands of Montanans."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Presently local taxing authorities are limited to increasing their budgets by one-half of the rate of inflation. Wages and benefits can not be sustained when budgets don't keep pace with inflation, leading to staffing reductions and difficulty recruiting and retaining staff. Ultimately, services are impacted. To sustain budgets and reduce the burden on residential property tax payers the legislature needs to rebalance the tax burden among the sixteen classes of property, reducing the residential property tax burden. Montana's three propert tax assistance programs, the PTAP (Property Tax Assistance Program), the Elderly Homeowners' Credit and the Disabled Veterns Program need to be expanded to serve more Montanans in need."

          "answer": "As I previously indicated, it is critical that the legislature reauthorize the Montana Medicaid program. Additionally, reimbursement schedules need to be enhanced in order to sustain rural hospitals. In the past two years, twelve Montana nursing home have closed due to low reimbursement rates making them financially unsustainable. Due to the rural nature of so much of our state it is also imperative that access to telehealth be expanded, particularly with regard to behavioral and mental health."

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "Montana's beginning teachers' salaries rank 51st in the nation (less than all fifty states and Washington D.C.) Recruitment and retention of teachers is increasingly difficult given the cost of housing in Montana's urban settings. State revenue from resource extraction and income taxes (not property taxes) must be devoted to enhancing the state budget for education. In 2023 we had a state budget surplus in excess of one billion dollars; as a result of our expanding economy we are currently on pace to have a surplus of $785 million in January of 2025. More resources must be allocated to rectify our failure to adequatey fund K-12 education and the Montana University System."

The governors property tax task force is working now and will have ideas for the 2025 session to consider. We may need to redistribute rates to relieve residential taxes.

          "answer": "I was born on the Air Force Academy in Colorado. When my father separated from the military, we moved to Medford, OR. After high school, I served honorably in the Air Force as a cop and was deployed to Afghanistan from 2009-2010. I was an Honor Graduate, Distinguished Graduate, Emergency Service Team Member, and received many other awards. After separating, I worked in management until 2016. I then used the GI Bill to finish my teaching degree. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Montana Western. Later, I received my master's degree. I live and teach in St. Regis and I am 35 years old. I have seen the world and real tyranny. I am a student of history and I have a duty to serve Montana to protect our posterity."

We are almost 35 trillion dollars in debt, we have a federal government who is filled with career politicians, we have a state that refuses to hear the petitions of 38 out of 56 counties who said that our property taxes are too high. There's widespread fraud, waste and abuse of tax money; and that same government who takes an oath to defend our constitution, openly violates it. Montana needs to band together and hold our federal and state governments accountable, while passing legislation that protects our elections, our sovereignty, our money, our families, our privacy, our resources and our right to be left alone.

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "The first question should be: What are \"essential services?\" There are needs and wants and the record has proven that often times our government spends money on things they want, but do not need. I signed a constitutional initiative a few years ago to put a cap on property taxes because of this exact problem. It should have been put on the ballot, but because the Montana Supreme Court killed it, we are faced with a government who demands more from us every year. Government spending must be decreased by law in support of the people. If the budget in years past worked, why can it not work now? The argument of population growth or inflation does not hold weight when last year we had a surplus of 2.5 billion dollars in taxes. "

          "answer": "Government should be out of the free market. That is why it is called the \"free market.\" Government should not partner with private health insurance companies because the merging of government and corporate powers, according to Benito Mussolini, is fascism. No additional steps should be taken by our state legislature until there can be a guarantee that our tax dollars are not being wasted. The private, free market should be protected and encouraged to offer competitive health insurance options to all socioeconomic classes in Montana. If any laws are to be passed to enhance health care access, it would be to protect individuals who use cost sharing health co ops (instead of insurance monopolies) from abuses.  "

          "answer": "The state should not be raising our kids, period. I am a public school teacher and I can tell you from real world experience, throwing more money at our problems in education is not going to solve anything. We need a cultural shift in our country. We need to take ownership of our families (I have two boys, ages 3 and 1.5) and raise them to love the Lord with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength, and to love their neighbors as themselves. We need to encourage active participation of school board elections and meetings, and we need to make sure that our tax dollars follow the child, no matter if that is to a public school, charter school, or homeschool. There does not need to be any increases in public school funding.   "

I am a retired educator with an BA in Elementary Education and a MA in Education. Growing up on a ranch in the foothills of the Beartooth Mountains, my dad instilled in me a strong work ethic. He always said, “If there is a job, just do it!” My rural upbringing, my years as an educator, parenting and advocating for environmental, social and education issues has helped me prepare to serve in the Montana State Legislature. These experiences have served me well the past three terms. I show up, advocate for my constituents and work collaboratively. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve Montana and do this important work. "

I will support affordable and accessible housing reform, I will work towards a fair and equitable tax policy, and I will vote for the continuation of the expansion of Medicaid. As a member of the Education Budget Sub Committee, I will work towards providing a budget that addresses inflation to the agencies we oversee, and I will advocate for crucial programs within these specific agencies to make certain they remain and are secure. As we navigate budgetary decisions, I will support adequate funding for government services including public education, health, and corrections. "

          "answer": "During the 2025 legislative session, the legislature will have an opportunity to design an equitable tax policy. Over the past decades and most recently with dramatically increasing home valuations, the tax burden has unfairly shifted to Montana’s residential property taxpayers and other taxpayers with low and moderate incomes. Opportunities include a special option sales tax, tax credits for qualifying families, consideration of a homestead exemption, and carefully analyzing residential property reappraisals. As lawmakers, we need to create equitable property tax classifications, we need to eliminate income tax reductions, and we must create a top income tax bracket to shift some tax responsibility to the wealthy. \n"

As of June 2023, 328,538 Montana citizens were enrolled in Montana Medicaid. Medicaid Expansion has kept health care accessible for all Montanans including children, covers preventive services to identify health issues early, provides needed behavioral health services and ultimately has kept people working. The state budget benefits with the federal government providing approximately $900 million into Montana annually. Medicaid strengthens the health care sector, keeps services available in urban and rural Montana communities, and supports new economic activity. \n "

The Decennial Study of school funding will occur in the interim after the 2025 legislature and will assess the educational needs and costs related to the basic system and make recommendations to the 2027 legislature. This delays needed support that our school districts would benefit from sooner than later. In 2025, I will work with educational leaders across the state as we navigate the proposed budgets for opportunities to enhance funding at all levels of the Montana Education system by working to remove or increasing the inflationary cap and by keeping public dollars in our public schools.

Young Montanans must move out of state to find good paying jobs and affordable homes, as people with high salaries and large retirement accounts from the East Coast, West Coast, and big cities (who can work from anywhere) are buying up properties and driving up home and land prices in the state. Many small businesses are losing their employees, in part, because those workers cannot afford housing in some regions of Montana. \n I would propose tax breaks and waiving of building permit fees to businessmen who build housing units for their employees. \n\n2)Rising Taxes.

When business owners spend less time on government red tape, they have more resources to expanding & improving business, leading to more job opportunities = more workers, more tax base.\nThe legislature should consider a tax on the purchase of luxury items .

I will always vote in support of a women’s right to control their own body, health care and family planning.\n\nHousing is another pressing issue, and I think the government can play a role in making housing more affordable.

          "answer": "A lot of our property taxes go towards local roads and schools. The state could help alleviate property taxes by paying more of the cost for local schools and roads. Most people had their property taxes increased this year due to the GOP administration failing to reduce that tax rate (despite their own Department of Revenue advising them to do so). Yet our local schools are still struggling, resulting in an emergency for local taxpayers. The state government needs to listen to local governments and taxpayers and invest in the basics we all value, like good public schools and roads. Another example of the state not listening to local taxpayers is when Missoula County adopted, by popular vote, a local 2 cent gas tax, as a way to alleviate pro"

The problem is that extremists in the state government are re-directing taxpayer funds to private religious schools while also failing to make adequate budgets for schools. The school funding formula is complex and I support adjustments that will allow pay increases for teachers, maintenance of school buildings, and having the state pay a fair share of these expenses instead of passing them off to property taxes."

Before being elected to the legislature, I volunteered for the boards of a multitude of civic, non-profit, agriculture, childhood and education related causes in Missoula.

Property taxes: Legislators had ample time and opportunity to fix the personal property tax debacle we currently find ourselves in, but the governor’s office instead chose to send out rebate checks instead of fixing the problem. Thankfully, Montanans saw through the charade and voiced their strong opposition. Legislation is needed to adjust personal property tax rates. Abortion is healthcare and needs to be fully protected in our state constitution. Public education needs to be properly funded as required by our constitution. Global warming is a threat to Montanans' lives and livelihoods and should be our next priority."

          "answer": "Many businesses and corporations actually received tax breaks this last legislative session due to the ongoing tax shift from businesses and corporations to the homeowner. Property tax rates have recently shifted where 60% of the burden is now on personal property owners and 40% is paid by businesses and corporations. This used to be reversed, making home ownership much more difficult for working families. I hear the argument that if businesses pay more taxes, they will just pass the cost along to the consumer. I feel consumers can better manage their personal finances by cutting out non-essential purchases and services, but what can someone on a fixed income do to lower their tax bill? Sell their house? I don’t think that is a solution."

          "answer": "As an 11+ year school board member and a product of our public schools, I understand many of the challenges schools face. If we want to retain high quality educators, they need to be paid a living wage. I wonder why some legislators claim they support increased teacher pay and school funding, then turn around and vote against it. The state needs to fully fund public education and stop diverting public funds to private schools. We should allow public schools to be included in the state insurance fund. We need to elect a state school superintendent that stops undermining our school system and will prioritize public education."

Through scholarships, loans and public medical school, I was able to become a doctor who specialized in pediatric cancer care and then pediatric hospice.

This healthcare should cover mental health services and provide care for those with substance use issues. Our rural and critical access hospitals are essential for rural Montanans and depend on Medicaid to remain fiscally viable and available to provide care services to patients in those areas.

We are not dedicating the level of funding necessary to meet our constitutional promise to develop the full educational potential of all persons. We need to pay teachers at a level that will attract and retain them, whether in a kindergarten or a college. We need to support curriculum at a level that ensures students can develop their unique talents, as well as have their unique needs met. We need to ensure that college is affordable so that the debt level college graduates assume and the housing crisis they face in Montana will not force them to leave the state."

          "answer": "Government is not efficient at providing healthcare, either through insurance (Medicare) or directly (Veterans Administration). They are rife with mismanagement and fraud which result in higher costs. Without government restrictions, treatment and medicines would be much cheaper. High quality care can be maintained if doctor and hospital performances are published instead of being shielded by the Board of Medical Examiners. COVID proved that we can bring effective and safe medicines to market without the long and costly process currently in force. Help for lower-income Montanans should come from private groups who know and care about the recipients instead of government bureaucrats simply looking to preserve their jobs."

          "answer": "Throwing more tax money at schools will not solve the problem which is not so much the amount of money available as it is the way that money is spent. Schools with falling enrollment and/or performance should be merged or closed. The administrative burden on schools should be reduced so that we can focus on teachers. Maintenance should not be put off until it is critical and expensive. Schools should be required to report on scholastic performance and how our taxes are being spent. Parents must be more active in oversight. Private solutions (vouchers and charter schools) should be encouraged."

As a legislator, I would propose and support legislation that requires all MT residents to pay their fair share of taxes and state government is held accountable for how our tax dollars are being spent. The money our state collects in taxes must be spent wisely. As legislators, we must not pass laws that are unconditional or have unconditional elements that send us down the path of litigation. Dollars spent on legal fees should instead be allocated for increase in salaries for our law enforcement officers, fire fighters and to support our veterans along with lowering property taxes. "

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "I believe we have to make changes on how Montana funds public schools to help decrease our property taxes. The Montana Constitution guarantees that all students receive a fair and quality public education. The basic entitlement for all schools needs to be increased by using state funds. While the push for charter schools may increase opportunities for some students, inevitably our state will not be able to adequately support our public schools. With increased state funding, schools won't need to run levies, therefore reducing the tax liability of our residents. I believe a primary residence should be taxed at 75% of the assessed value. We should encourage more film making in MT and negotiate a portion of proceeds to fund the tax base."

I believe the legislature and other government leaders should work together to ensure our residents can access medical care through ride share vouchers to clinics, offer incentives to healthcare providers for working in the most rural parts of our state, especially our reservations, and help with getting medications at a lower cost.

          "answer": "A public school education is the greatest equalizer we have. The Montana school funding formula needs to be changed. As an educator for the past 30 years in a K-12 school, I have witnessed first-hand the repercussions of inadequate school funding. As I mentioned before, we need to ensure all Montana residents are paying their fair share of taxes. We need to eliminate unnecessary spending of our tax dollars. I believe we should research the idea of a state wide salary schedule for educators to attract quality applicants.  Furthermore, the state needs to institute a policy that they will reimburse the cost of a grant writer for each school (K-12, college/universities and vocation education program). "

I have long been a proud Democrat.   I am a strong conservationist who believes we should wisely manage our fish and wildlife and the habitats on which they depend.  I passionately believe that both the United States and Montana should be intent on building a just and fair society and that we have the wealth and resources to ensure that every individual has adequate health care, a quality education and an equal opportunity to realize their full potential.

I am working hard to ensure the voters approve CI-128 in the November election. The next legislative session must address tax fairness for property owners and continue to promote more affordable housing for both renters and homebuyers.  We must extend Medicaid so that more of our citizens have access to quality healthcare and to ensure our rural hospitals stay in business.  Protecting water quality will also be a top priority because developers will be seeking to weaken laws that protect water quality and water quantity.  "

          "answer": "\nIn the 2023 legislative session, the Republican supermajority refused to address property tax reform and as a result property taxes skyrocketed for homeowners even as they were reduced for utilities and corporations.  We must bring tax fairness back to our property tax system by creating a tax formula that ensures commercial and residential properties rise or fall proportionally with residential property taxes.  We also need additional measures in law to protect homeowners on fixed incomes. "

          "answer": "\nI strongly support Medicaid and will vote to continue Medicaid expansion in the 2025 session. The Legislature approved Montana's participation in the federal Medicaid program in 2013 and 2019 to ensure lower income Montanans had access to health care.  This legislation will sunset next year and there will be a major debate in the next Legislature about whether to extend Medicaid.  I will fight to ensure that the 239,000 men, women and children who depend on Medicaid continue to have access to health care.  Beyond cutting off the health care needed by many Montanans, ending Medicaid will severely impact many hospitals and lead to hospital closures throughout rural Montana. "

          "answer": "In the last two sessions, Republicans in the Legislature robbed our public schools by granting taxpayer financed tax credits to wealthy individuals making contributions to private schools. In 2023, Republicans passed laws allowing private schools to receive public school dollars and excused these schools from any public accountability.  The Office of Public Instruction has been decimated by Republican Superintendent Elsie Arntzen. The 2025 Legislature must prioritize strengthening our public schools and require accountability from OPI.  The Legislature must also increase starting teacher salaries so that we are competitive with other states. Montana's beginning teacher salaries are the lowest in the nation.  "

I'll be 44 on Election Day, 2024. \n\nMontana is my home, and I share many experiences with the constituents I represent: I'm a parent, a renter, and a worker; I enjoy spending time in our amazing Montana wilderness and I rely on community resources like our public library and our parks and trails. I also have two decades of experience as a community organizer. These experiences make it possible for me to represent Missoula effectively."

Fortunately, there are good policy solutions for each.  These include: lifting the sunset on Medicaid expansion, passing the Housing Fairness Tax Credit, changing the inflation caps on school funding, and strengthening renters' rights and emergency rental assistance programs.\n\nI also believe that our mental health care system is at a crossroads in terms of caring for people in crisis or turning our backs on them. These solutions will be longer-term but we nonetheless must start now."

          "answer": "I support passing the Montana Housing Fairness Tax Credit, a program that provides property tax relief for people based on their income. This tax credit, similar to the existing Elderly Homeowner's Tax Credit, provides an income tax refund to individuals who pay more than a set percentage of their income in property taxes.\n\nI believe this is a good solution because it does not change the amount of revenue collected by local governments, and also targets the tax relief to low-income Montanans who need it the most. It avoids the pitfalls of other proposals which end up being another tax cut for the very wealthy, and also makes sure that schools, counties, and communities continue to thrive."

          "answer": "First and foremost, we must lift the sunset on Medicaid expansion and make that program permanent. It has been a crucial and effective program for Montanans for a decade and we need to stop treating it as a political football. Second, we must continue to adjust the Medicaid provider rates so that healthcare workers are paid appropriately and we can recruit and retain a robust healthcare workforce. Lastly, we need to invest in community-based mental and behavioral health - everything from local nursing homes to substance use disorder treatment to in-patient mental health beds. We need to stop relying on the State Hospital and our jails to provide crisis care in the state.\n"

What proposals, if any, would you support to ensure adequate and sustainable long-term funding is available for public pre-K–12, college/university, and vocational education programs?",
          "answer": "I support adjusting the inflation cap on school funding (currently set at 3%) to more accurately reflect the needs of school districts and the reality of our economy. I also support increases to the state employee pay plan to ensure that teachers at every level are competitively paid. I oppose efforts to privatize education, especially at the K-12 levels, as this directs resources away from the education systems that serve all Montana kids."

What changes to the state tax system, if any, would you support to provide property tax relief while maintaining sufficient revenue for essential services?",
          "answer": "Montana currently has a $2.6 billion dollar budget surplus. In 2021, the governor and the legislature reduced the income tax rate. In 2023, the legislature reduced the income tax rate. Manipulating the income tax rate has destabilized the property tax rate causing a significant increase. $2.6 billion in budget surplus does not reflect a balanced budget. House Bill 212 gave additional business property tax exemptions. Meanwhile we saw a significant increase in property taxes. Tax relief in other places was placed on the backs of property owners. Increase property tax trickles down to increased rent in areas already suffering from limited affordable housing. "

          "answer": "Crisis response teams embedded in City Fire and Police often serve and interact with non-resident people. The funding for these services need to be offset with state funds, potentially from the $2.6 billion dollars in budget surplus. Funding crisis response teams enables mental health to be properly addressed at the scene and reduces the amount of times the police need to detain or hospitalize people during a mental health crisis, thereby lowering over all cost to the tax payers.

          "answer": "Funding pre-k allows parents to return to the work force earlier, increasing the economic stability of the community and the household, and thereby adding to the income tax paid to the state. It also provides earlier structured education to the children of all income brackets, that currently might not be available to children in lower income households. "

I started Big Sky Life Support HCBS in 2015 & moved the company to a non-profit in 2023.

I am running to ravamp our Medicaid system to eliminate reporting requirements by the consumer & placing in the hands of their case manager. If you are actively receiving case management, reporting your income to multiple agencies to keep your case active is a waste of tax payer monies.

          "answer": "I believe Montana can do better. I would propose that we start growing industrial hemp from the east to the west and from the north to the south.

If we provide free housing for both populations, we can train single mothers and fathers to support the chronically homeless mentally ill in a supportive housing community. This would reduce crime in Missoula and the use of our first responders significantly. This also retain healthcare workers for this population & reduce the monetary requirement for workers to just survive in Missoula County. I believe through supporting this population and producing commodities we will more than pay for this program, but will bring prosperity to Missoula and across Montana. "

          "answer": "The state currently receives less than $10 for the sale of 1 ounce of Medical marijuana and Montana school systems receive a very small portion of this money. The bottom line with all those receiving SSI and SSDI payments is that Montanan’s are the ones paying $200 an ounce for product & receiving a minuscule return. Removing grow regulations for providers, using Medicaid to pay for the script for cannabis at $100 per ounce, and requiring a $100 co-pay from those on Medicaid, would return $100 to the state and could significantly increase the budget for public schools. \n"
