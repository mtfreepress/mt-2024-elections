    "summaryNarrative": "Downing, 57, is the state’s current state auditor and commissioner of securities and insurance. He has previously worked in the technology, insurance and real estate industries.\n\nDowning grew up in California but has had a home in Montana since 1998. He says he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard after the September 11 terrorist attacks and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough Downing has spent much of his time in Montana living in the state’s western congressional district — places like Gallatin Gateway and Big Sky — he lives in Helena in his capacity as a state official. \n\nDowning has served as Montana’s state auditor, or securities and insurance commissioner, since 2021. He chose to make a bid for Congress this year instead of pursuing a second four-year term in that role.\n\nIn public statements about his candidacy, Downing has focused on concerns about the southern border and inflation. He has also touted his business and military experience.\n\n“I think that’s what voters want,” he [told MTN News](https://www.ktvh.com/replacing-rosendale/troy-downing-republican-candidate-for-montanas-eastern-u-s-house-seat) in an interview published in May. “They want somebody who is going to show up, roll up their sleeves, do the work — that understands what it’s like to build a business, understand what it’s like to go to war, understands what it’s like to sign the front of a payroll check.\n\nDowning [pleaded guilty in 2018](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/govt-and-politics/former-us-senate-candidate-acknowledges-hunting-violations/article_3523a095-5b50-5da2-a616-039c370fc8df.html?gv=1) to two misdemeanor charges of obtaining resident hunting licenses for several years while not officially a Montana resident. At the time, Downing argued the matter was the result of his accountants preparing tax forms that listed him as a California resident. According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, he was ordered to pay a $2,110 fine and forego hunting and fishing privileges for 18 months. \n\nDowning’s campaign declined to provide responses for MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on prior MTFP reporting and biographical information published this year by the [Billings Gazette](https://billingsgazette.com/news/local/troy-downing-congress-house-montana-eastern-district/article_e53d7606-f1fb-11ee-85b2-4798069cd1b9.html) and [MTN News](https://www.ktvh.com/replacing-rosendale/troy-downing-republican-candidate-for-montanas-eastern-u-s-house-seat).\n",

Jon Tester this year. \n\nSheehy, a Minnesota native who moved to Montana in 2014 and founded the aerial firefighting company Bridger Aerospace, said he didn’t consider entering politics until the U.S.’s withdrawal from Afghanistan, a chaotic exit in which 13 American troops were killed in addition to hundreds of Afghan civilian casualties. \n\n“It was heart-wrenching,” he told MTFP. “I fought in our nation’s longest war. I worked to save our allies. I understand duty, service and sacrifice. That day showed me something was seriously wrong in D.C. and motivated me to run for U.S. Senate.”\n\nHis policy priorities include reducing the federal deficit, tightening immigration laws and restricting American support for Ukraine. Although Sheehy has donated to past political rivals of former President Donald Trump, he received Trump’s endorsement in February and pledges to work with Trump if elected. \n\n“America is at a crossroads, and it’s time for a new generation of leaders to save our country from the career politicians — Republicans and Democrats — who run for office after office, go to D.C. to get rich, and lecture us about ‘fighting for you’ while our problems only get worse,” Sheehy told MTFP. \n\nThis biography is based on material Sheehy provided to MTFP as well as [prior MTFP coverage](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/04/28/donald-trump-jr-rallies-for-republican-support-montana-candidates/) of his campaign.\n",

          "answer": "We must bring accountability to D.C. Like many Montanans, I’m tired of hearing career politicians talk about how they’re going to “fight” for America while our problems only get worse.\n\nFrom our nation’s out-of-control debt, the crisis at our southern border, the broken VA, and the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, the career politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. are not being held accountable. It's time to remind Washington what it means to have service, sacrifice, and accountability at the center of your mission.\n\nThat’s why one of my first actions as a candidate was to sign the Term Limits Pledge because we need more accountability and less career politicians. I’m committed to ensuring that politicians who fail to pass a balanced budget don’t get paid. And Montana veterans will have no bigger advocate than a fellow veteran to fight for them and fulfill the promise our nation made to them.\n\nMontanans have an opportunity to secure our children’s future and save America. Let’s take it.\n"

          "answer": "Our country is facing serious problems, and we need serious people to solve them. Record inflation, open borders, rising crime, collapsing foreign policy, unattainable housing prices and out-of-control debt. America is at a crossroads. Control of the U.S. Senate will decide if we can solve these problems to save the American Dream and deliver prosperity and growth while protecting our freedoms and liberties.\n\nAs senator, I will work to end illegal immigration once and for all, rebuild our economy with low inflation, unleash American energy, get tough on crime, fix the VA and put America First.\n\nPresident Biden has failed our nation and is one of the worst presidents we’ve ever had. President Trump will win in November, and I look forward to working with him to deliver the commonsense policies Montanans want, and our country needs: safe streets, cheap gas, a secure border, America First foreign policy, a strong economy, a balanced budget, good schools, boys are boys and girls are girls.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I’m incredibly proud and honored to have the support of President Donald J. Trump as we fight to take back the Senate and save America. As conservative political outsiders and successful businessmen, we will always fight for Montanans and put America First!\n\nThis race will determine control of the Senate, and with President Trump in office, the Senate is critical to advancing the America First agenda.\n\nWe need political outsiders to deliver the commonsense solutions Montanans want, and our country needs, but career politicians back in D.C. haven’t delivered. Under President Trump’s leadership, our economy was booming, our border was secure, and America was respected on the world stage. Together, we will take on and defeat the D.C. establishment and career politicians selling out our country, rebuild our economy, secure the border, get tough on crime, re-establish peace through strength, restore Montana common sense in D.C., drain the swamp, and Make America Great Again!\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "We are $34 trillion in debt. $34 trillion. The spending in Washington is out of control, and the career politicians are doing absolutely nothing to rein it in. Let’s be clear: We have a spending problem —  not a revenue problem.\n\nIf we don’t fix our spending problem, we’ll be handing our children an insolvent nation, and the only thing our tax dollars will do is service our national debt. We must balance the budget and begin to lower our national debt. \n  \nThe quickest way to balance the budget is to ensure that politicians who fail to pass a balanced budget don’t get paid. You’re not allowed to run your business that way, and they shouldn’t be allowed to run our nation that way. If politicians can’t pass a balanced budget, they shouldn’t get paid. No balanced budget, no paycheck!\n\nWe must also start cutting wasteful spending that doesn’t put America First —  no more blank checks to Ukraine or sending billions to regimes, like Iran, that chant “Death to America!”\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I am proudly pro-life and support commonsense protections for when a baby can feel pain, as well as exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, and I believe any further limits must be left to each state.\n\nLike most Montanans, I believe that allowing an elective abortion up until the moment of birth is an extreme position.\n\nI strongly believe in helping bring more life into this world, including through our philanthropy benefitting Montana health care, which helped bring the upgraded neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to the Gallatin Valley to provide critical care to at-risk infants and helping Billings Clinic establish Montana’s first level one trauma center.\n\nI also stand in support of IVF as a path for families to grow and thrive when they struggle to conceive naturally, like my brother and sister-in-law who battled infertility and eventually were blessed with my nephew through IVF. I will fight against any effort to restrict IVF treatments for women and families.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Record inflation has made the American Dream of homeownership tougher and tougher to achieve for Montanans. The reckless spending out of D.C. has given us record-high inflation, sky-high interest rates, higher building costs and rising prices on everything from homes to groceries. We need to rebuild our economy with low inflation. I will work to end the out-of-control spending and the disastrous economic policies that are crushing Montana families and small businesses.\n\nWe must also start taking advantage of our abundant natural resources and building more homes with Montana timber. In the middle of a housing crisis, why are we buying our timber and shipping it in from foreign countries when we could be getting it for cheaper while growing our economy right here in Montana? It makes no sense.\n\nWe should be able to responsibly manage our forests here at home to create more high-paying jobs, lower housing costs, support our communities, and protect the environment. That’s common sense.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "The climate has always been changing, but the Leftist Climate Cult agenda is not about the environment, it’s about control.\n\nWe must stand strong against the radical climate cult agenda that senselessly kills Montana jobs, weakens our economy, crushes business, devastates our communities and strips Montanans of their freedoms by weaponizing ESG. As a public company’s CEO, I know personally how this woke crap is stripping us of our freedoms.\n\nWe need to embrace commonsense policies that benefit the economy and environment simultaneously. It’s time to make America energy independent and dominant again by unleashing all forms of American energy and innovation and increasing active forest management. We should be able to responsibly develop those resources here at home to create more high-paying jobs, lower energy costs and support our communities, all while protecting the environment. This isn’t an either/or choice like the left would have you believe. We can do both.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "President Biden inherited a secure border but created the worst border crisis in our history.\n\nCongress could've held the Biden administration accountable for its disastrous policies in April by holding an impeachment trial for DHS Sec. Mayorkas and Jon Tester voted to dismiss it.\n\nAs senator, I’ll fight to defend America, stop the invasion and keep deadly drugs, like Chinese fentanyl, off our streets. But let's be clear: Joe Biden created this crisis and he has the authority—without help from Congress—to fix it.\n\nWe must stop incentivizing illegal immigration and restore President Trump’s successful policies of Remain in Mexico and ending Catch and Release. We can’t keep spending billions on handouts for illegals while we’re $34 trillion in debt, have homeless veterans on the street and hardworking Americans struggle to make ends meet.\n\nWe need new, strong leadership to crush the cartels, finish the wall, seal the border, end illegal immigration once and for all and put America First!\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "Our health care system is broken. I hear it from Montanans in their communities across the state. Because of Obamacare, Montanans face higher premiums year after year. Americans have lost access to doctors and health care plans they were told they could keep.\n\nMore government control of our health care has only made things worse. We must increase access and lower costs.\n\nLike most Montanans, I believe we need to promote greater transparency, competition and shopping for services in our health care system. As someone who was wounded in battle and has had to deal with the VA, I know firsthand we should be rewarding outcomes and innovation, improving access to care in our rural communities, and most importantly, protecting Montanans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nThat's why I proudly donated millions across Montana to increase access to critical health care services, bring the upgraded NICU to the Gallatin Valley and help Billings Clinic establish Montana’s first level one trauma center.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?",
          "answer": "We must put America First. If we're going to send military support overseas, we better damn well know why we're doing it, the American people better be behind it, and it better benefit our national interest.\n\nWe can't let the politicians back in Washington keep putting America Last and shoveling our resources, people and cash overseas as other countries take advantage of us. Everything we do as a country, domestically and internationally, should benefit the American people and serve our national interest, because when America acts in its own interest, the rest of the world benefits. When we're a strong America with a strong economy and a strong presence, everyone else benefits. We must get back to that. \n\nOur government should always serve American interests and put Americans first. That's what America First means, and that's the type of commonsense leadership I'm going to fight for in the Senate.\n"

Smith was a school board trustee for Somers Lakeside School District 29 but resigned in January 2023.

          "answer": "All of us conservative Republicans tried fixing this in the 2023 session. The entire tax appraisal formula needs to be based off of acquisition value not fair market value. What you paid for your house is what you are taxed on. As governor I intend to return to mining, logging and responsibly utilizing our natural resources. The property tax problem is because the tax burden has shifted to residential property owners where as 30 years ago proceeds from natural resource taxes is what funded local government. \n\n"

What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?",
          "answer": "The school finance system of ANB funding is fine. It's not a funding issue. Private schools educate their students with less money and students generally have better outcomes. The public schools need to return to the three R's of education. Private schools and home schools are taking children out of the public school because the parents don't want their children indoctrinated. They went woke and they're going broke. Many public schools are top-heavy with administration and those funds should go to the teachers. Many schools also went fully computerized with Google classroom and the cyber and ransom insurance for these platforms is extremely expensive. These schools could buy text books and pay their teachers much higher salaries. \n\n"

What are your priorities regarding abortion access?",
          "answer": "I believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death. If the Legislature brought me that bill I would sign it. Every life matters and unborn babies have the right to live. As a husband, father and man I need to protect those that can't protect themselves. \n\n"

          "answer": "I would have to see what bill comes out of the 2025 Legislature. We need to provide some assistance for the health care of children and those folks in need of temporary coverage. I also believe people who can work need to work and provide for themselves, including their health insurance. There needs to be sideboards and curbs on Medicaid or it will become financially unsustainable like every governmental assistance program.

          "question": "Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?",
          "answer": "This is what happens when you vote for Democrats and regulate fossil fuels out of business. Housing prices are based off of energy production. Higher inputs for developers and builders equals higher outputs to consumers. As governor I would advance the cause of Montana becoming energy independent. I will insulate Montana from the bad policies coming out of Washington D.C. The state of Montana shouldn't be picking winners and losers with regards to who gets housing assistance. The folks getting the assistance are doing so at the detriment of another. I would support the use of tax abatements to allow the private sector to start building again. What's missing in the rental/housing discussion is ‘Why are people short of money?’ Tax proceeds from recreational cannabis will be $100 million in 2024. That revenue is 20% of the $500 million spent on pot? $500 million \"reported\" in this cash business..... really $600 million, $1 billion? Our entire state annual budget is $7 billion.\n\n"

As governor I would advocate for and educate the people on living by the \"Golden Rule\" and be kind to one another. Treating others the way you want to be treated resonates with all ages and genres.\n"

From day one of my first professional job, I have been responsible for regulatory compliance. I also have significant experience understanding complex technological systems.\n\nAs an engineer, I served as a principal investigator and manager in research and development projects funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). My mission was to gather scientific evidence, analyze data and judge the feasibility of specific technologies related to energy and the environment. This background proves that I have the quality of mind, integrity, commitment, experience, and knowledge to make an excellent public service commissioner for Montana. The PSC is more technical than other elected offices, so expertise matters. I think Montanans should elect candidates who are well-rounded professional experts and not career politicians.\n\n"

Some good points were made by both sides. \n\nI fully support the PSC’s decision to embrace determining its appropriate role here. However, it would be inappropriate for me, as a candidate to this quasi-judicial body, to publicly take a position. In doing so, I could be challenged as prejudice and get removed from the actual or future related cases.

Montana residents and small businesses will benefit as all cost-effective energy sources are developed and deployed on a level playing field. But the base load supply must be kept sufficient to sustain through prolonged Montana winter conditions. \n\nTo ensure Montana’s grid reliability, the procurement and production of essential grid components should be advocated for and sourced from Montana when practical, including the mining of copper and the harvesting of lumber. \n\nIdeally, Montana should be resource independent and strive to be a net energy exporter. This will bring down our energy costs significantly and at the same time position our Montana economy in a healthier place. With my head for details and a heart for the consumer, I will insist that the corporations always put the wellbeing of ratepayers ahead of groups representing special interests.\n\n"

Ideally, completive free market principles would work. Reality is the job of the Public Service Commission. When on the PSC, I will not engage in corporate protectionism, and instead I will insist that companies pay fully for their bad business decisions. Those costs should never be passed on to the consumer. The PSC should regulate monopolies as though they are operating in a free market economy. The PSC’s role is to protect the ratepayer. It is not to save a monopoly from itself through avoidance of accountability. Regulation must approximate a competitive environment, rewarding good business decisions, while providing incentive for appropriate business discipline.\n\n"

As part of an open government process, through public outreach I plan to develop and give educational presentations detailing the steps of rate decisions. Transparency brings accountability to governmental processes.\n\nI want to see Montana strive for energy independence and have energy solutions planned into the future. I support the development and advancement of all cost-effective energy resources and energy storage technologies. By promoting Montana First regulatory policies, the PSC will best ensure Montana has a strong economy, which correlates to constant, reliable, affordable utilities, as well as a safe and healthy environment in which to continue our Montana way of life.\n"

I will support professional development for educators, improve customer service from OPI, reduce state administrative burdens on schools, and remain accountable when schools fall short.

          "question": "Regulatory matters under the PSC’s jurisdiction are often highly specialized and complex. Please describe your qualifications for performing the technical aspects of the commission's work.",
          "answer": "I have the ability to understand complex topics. This is a result of training and multiple career projects. I conducted energy surveys for commercial buildings and provided upgrade recommendations for realizing direct and indirect energy savings. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, I served as an energy specialist with the State and Local Initiatives Program where I took technical research and information and reworded it for education and outreach materials. \n\nI currently teach two classes: Energy & Sustainability and Energy-Efficient Technologies and Renewable Energy for Gallatin College’s workforce program. The latter class covers the thermal, mechanical and electrical aspects of advanced technologies. I also explain the utility grid including microgrids and smart grid technologies.\n\nThus, I am very knowledgeable about energy and would be a quick study on energy and utility topics I need to learn about to properly serve as a commissioner. \n\n"

          "question": "To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?",
          "answer": "The PSC must address climate change in its decision-making to address ratepayer costs as well as societal and ecosystem health. This can be accomplished while overseeing utility long-term plan development.\n\nThe main way the PSC can address climate change is to give renewable energy projects fair and due consideration because they do not require combustion to generate heat energy or electricity. Thus, when compared to fossil fuels, renewable energy does not emit greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change. Renewables also do not emit pollution that negatively impacts human health. The Montana Climate Assessment provides specific information on how Montana agricultural producers, water resources and our forests are already experiencing negative impacts from climate change. This significantly impacts Montana’s economy. Thus, by addressing climate change, the PSC can protect Montanans in multiple ways. \n\n\n"

          "question": "Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?",
          "answer": "Affordable rates can be achieved by implementing efficiency measures on both sides of the meter and by building utility-scale wind and solar electric power plants that are cheaper than fossil fuel-powered plants. Electricity can also be added to the grid from on-site and community solar projects. Renewables are free and not susceptible to volatile market prices. The PSC can invite competition by attracting businesses that build renewable energy projects and participating in western organized energy markets. \n\nRenewable energy systems built with battery storage provide reliable electricity available on demand when needed. Our utility grid must be modernized for reliability. Upgrades can include micro-grids that reduce line losses and prevent widespread power outages. Smart-grid technologies give ratepayers control over when and how they use energy to reduce peak demand as well costs. We must also protect the grid from extreme weather events, vandalism and hacking. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?",
          "answer": "First, direct the utilities to expand and better market current utility energy and water efficiency incentives and rebate programs to lower energy use regardless of the source. This will reduce natural gas and electricity bills. \n\nNext, provide the most cost-effective energy source available to us and that is renewable energy with storage. The PSC can approve utility plans to build power plants themselves or the PSC can ensure terms are favorable for attracting other businesses that would build the plants and the utility would buy the power.\n\nThe PSC can also lower power bills by directing the utilities to participate in western organized energy markets for trading and buying cheaper wholesale electricity. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?",
          "answer": "1. Montana and other western states are increasingly experiencing droughts that reduce the water needed to operate hydroelectric dams and potentially thermoelectric power plants — like Colstrip. This is one other benefit of wind and solar —  they do not require water for operation. Hydropower provides 36% of Montana’s electricity; thus, the PSC must consider this when overseeing utility long-range plan development.\n\n2. Colstrip’s economy depends on coal and the eventual closing of the power plant due to costs and pollution is a very contentious issue. Past efforts to address were deemed insufficient. Montana's governor, Legislature, NorthWestern Energy and the PSC need to step-up and develop a detailed, coordinated plan. It can include job training and providing incentives to attract companies looking to build. I would invite companies that manufacture components and technologies used for energy- and water-efficient buildings.\n"

We are an agricultural state and this district is driven by agriculture. It’s our number one industry, generating over $7 billion in activity last year, and the heartbeat of our rural communities and cities. However, under 6% of Congress works in agriculture, and even fewer work their land. Electing candidates who like to cosplay but don’t understand it and sure as heck haven’t delivered anything meaningful isn’t the answer. Rosendale voted against investments in critical irrigation projects that are essential. That’s not being a representative, that’s self-serving. Sen. Tester needs a partner in the House who understands agriculture and who will work in a bipartisan way to get things done for farmers and ranchers who feed the world.\n\n"

I’ll work cooperatively to deliver results for the Eastern District. I’m not alone in knowing that Rep. Rosendale delivered zilch for working folks and agriculture.

          "answer": "The debt increased by a record amount under Trump. Don’t be lied to by my opponents. They only want to steal your Social Security and give it to the Wall Street freeloaders. Solutions are on the table to collect from tax cheats and end giveaways to greedy corporations and billionaires but self-serving politicians work for them. Follow the money and muck the halls. The largest contribution to the historic debt was tax cuts for the rich and Wall Street. The richest nearly doubled their wealth while working people lost nearly as much. First, stop stealing from my pocket and neighbors’ pockets only to give it away to the ultra-wealthy. Second, let the tax cuts that only benefit the rich expire. Third, if billionaires and mega corporations benefit from the financial protections this country provides, pay your darn taxes. It’s unpatriotic to take advantage of our economic and financial system and not give back so we can reinvest in our country, the Americans who built it, and the future.\n\n"

          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Affording a decent place to live has become impossible for too many. Montana leads the nation with workers who can no longer afford basic necessities, like covering rent and health care. It wasn’t always that way and doesn’t have to be this way now. People want a fair shake and a hand up, not a handout. Provide tax credits and financial assistance for new construction and renovation, and rental assistance for those who cannot afford to buy a home right now. Congress should crack down on the speculators and monied land grabbers driving prices up by buying up land, farms, ranches and real estate. The only way we can solve our affordability problems facing the middle class and workers is by mucking the halls of this corruption. It starts with a ban on insider stock trading. We aren’t going to get things back on track if we don’t make a change and elect officials who are committed to cleaning up the corruption, not buying a seat to enrich themselves. I’ll work for you in Congress.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Climate change is real. We’ve already warmed an average of two degrees. That impacts our snowpack and water supplies —  essential for both agriculture and the outdoors, our economic engines. Worse, recurring drought, hail, and weather-related disasters for agriculture are becoming too common. This summer's forecast isn’t looking much better. My daughter is one of my heroes for standing up in defending our right to a clean and healthful environment in the Held v Montana youth climate lawsuit they won. After all those kids stood up for our rights and future, we must do our part and that means taking action. I’m running for Congress to carry our values of freedom, clean air and water, open and public lands, the outdoors, family farms and ranchers, and way of life forward. A good first step will be for the Farm Bill to fully fund conservation and climate resilience programs for family farmers and ranchers. Clean energy can unplug us from big utilities and provide energy freedom for all.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "The failure to pass the bipartisan border protection bill, introduced by a Republican, which would have addressed this crisis, for purely political reasons pissed me off so much I filed to run for this seat. We have a bill to protect our border, but self-serving politicians are blocking it in a desperate attempt to score points. Politics at its worst. That’s not good for Montana or America. I’ll do what's right for Montana and America every time because those are my values. Border security and immigration are two issues. I’ll never stop working to protect our borders, but unless your relatives were here before the Mayflower, we were all immigrants at some point. We’re darn lucky our families came here. I support pathways to citizenship, part of the American dream, and develop programs to bolster workforce opportunities to address worker shortages. We also need to address the root causes forcing people to uproot and leave their homes —  political unrest, corruption, violence, crime.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "I’d take it right to the pharmaceutical and health care corporations. We have the highest prices for prescriptions in the world. Taxpayers subsidize much of the development. That ain’t right. It’s price-gouging and Congress needs to do more to stop it by expanding our ability to negotiate for lower prescription prices to benefit all Montanans and Americans. Seniors, veterans, and others in need shouldn’t have to head to Canada for affordable life-saving medications. I would also look for ways to expand options and requirements for states to provide Medicaid to those who don’t receive health care through their employer. Gov. Gianforte just shamelessly kicked over 120,000 Montanans, including children, off of health care. Many have jobs but simply can’t afford other options. It’s not only cruel, but it's just bad business. It hurts employers whose employees lost coverage and, as we know, it will raise health care costs for everyone else — another tax — leading to rural provider closures.\n"

As a Libertarian, he said he also believes in ending American military aid to foreign countries. \n\n“I’m a Montanan with a rich family history, representing two American dreams,” he said. “On my mother’s side, the dream of early settlers in territorial Montana, and on my father’s, that of an Armenian immigrant, coming to America to work hard and make a new life.”\n\nThis biography is based on material Daoud provided to MTFP.\n",

          "answer": "Our biggest issue is our out-of-control national debt and inflation. We must stop spending, pass an actual budget (which Congress [hasn't] done in 28 years) that includes paying down our debt. We must demand that the Federal Reserve stop printing money until we see deflation. We can cut our budget by reducing the number of federal agencies and programs they administer. All this must be done immediately as we are currently callously spending our future generations’ future.\n"

Coincidentally my principles align with the principles of Montana and all I need to fall back on are the same lessons I grew up learning in our great state. Essentially the ideal of being left alone — less government intervention, more self-reliance. I personally doubt that President Biden is in charge of his own mental faculties let alone the nation.\n"

        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "It is our number one priority. Absolutely no tax increases whatsoever. We can provide a balanced budget, with cuts across the board. We can also reduce the size of the federal government by reducing the number of federal agencies. I do not see the value in any agency created after 1970. Their roles can be folded into existing agencies. None of this will be fun, but it is necessary to dig us out of the hole we are in and get us all back to adherence to the Constitution.\n"

          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I agree with the Supreme Court, abortion is not a federal issue. I however take it further; the government should be completely out of this issue.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "The best thing the federal government can do to address housing access for all is to start correcting our national debt, inflation and out of control spending. The local economy is affected by this critically. I face housing issues all the time on City Council here in Kalispell (the fastest-growing micropolitan city in the U.S.) and the only fix is to increase the number of units. We have done a great job in Kalispell to start addressing this with the units we have coming online. The national lockdown and Covid funding were crippling factors to this problem, and it is going to take bunch of hard work to correct this. The high cost of materials coupled with the scarcity of construction workers is a terrible combination.\n"

        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Climate change has turned into a power grab by government entities around the world. If we in the U.S. are serious about reducing our impact, we should do it the American way by supporting and getting out of the way of innovation by entrepreneurs. Regulating and taxing will fail as it always does. I am very concerned with the not-so-hidden global effort of depopulation, that scares me more than anything around this issue.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "This is probably the biggest hot button issue facing federal candidates this year. Unfortunately, the leadership of the two big parties have no intention of fixing the issue as it keeps their base in line and focused on the left-right war. I would begin to attack this issue by immediately stopping all social welfare for immigrants. We have not given this in the past and no one should expect tax dollars to be taken and then distributed to non-citizens. If we are going to have a border policy, it should be consistent to every border and consistent between agencies tasked with enforcement (which it is not today). I don’t think anyone would disagree that we need immigration policy reform.\n"

        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "The government needs to get out of the way. The best outcomes appear when there is little government involvement, and the free market can determine pricing (Lasik eye surgery is a great example of this). This is the only service that we engage with not knowing the cost to us until after the visit or procedure. Let the different providers compete with listed pricing and let insurance companies compete past state borders for a start.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?",
          "answer": "We should not. Period. We can only send aid at this time by increasing our debt or printing money (inflation) in other words we can only send support by hurting Americans to do it. If Congress is determined to support one side or the other, it can do its job and declare war. If we want to support wars in other countries the federal government can issue limited time special bonds, and let Americans decide if they wish to contribute of their own free will. We know when the bonds will mature and can budget for that. Our country cannot sustain all of the endless wars and troop deployments around the world, not to mention the severe impact this has on our veterans that return broken.\n"

Prior to that role, Allen served as deputy state superintendent under Elsie Arntzen, routinely representing the Office of Public Instruction in education policy discussions at the Legislature and before the Board of Public Education. Allen left the agency in July 2023.\n\nAllen was born in Choteau and raised in Fairfield. She got her start in school administration in the Augusta Public Schools, and from there went on to jobs at multiple other districts in Montana and Arizona. During her time at OPI, Allen says she led efforts to establish new approaches to teacher retention and student assessment and worked with state lawmakers, higher education leaders and local public school administrators on a range of other initiatives. She has emphasized student safety and parental rights as core issues in her campaign.\n\n“We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our kids,” Allen said, “and we need someone at the OPI that will fight for a bright future for each one of our kids while getting false philosophies out of what our kids experience.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Allen’s campaign via a written questionnaire as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n",

State policy needs to reflect that values that Montana stands for rather than the ideologies of foreign entities or those striving to rewrite the history of our nation and state.\n2. We all share the same air on this planet and building understanding and appreciation for different cultures and upbringing can be done through expanded exchange programs of teachers and students. As a Rotarian, I was able to send two teachers to India who came back with a strong message: Appreciate public education in America.\n3.

The Digital Communications team, early in the tenure was on fire and a tremendous asset in capturing and telling educational stories across the state.  This work was great.\n2. Telework implementation during COVID was a reflection of good as it tied strongly to the changing workforce and priorities. \n3. The focus on the family right-sized the lens of the OPI to remember the power and importance of parents. \n\nChallenges: \n1. The OPI staff turnover, and the loss of staff history - due to lack of systems to ensure systems worked on processes rather than people. \n2. The waning relationship with the Board of Public Education \n3. The elimination of monthly representation at MASS meetings - left the impression that the OPI was not so interested in the work of our school leaders or supporting their work.\n"

          "question": "Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?",
          "answer": "The state’s school funding formula has not been updated in years and consequently schools are not getting the adequate resources they need to operate. Over the last 11 years, I have built relationships with key stakeholders in statewide education including legislators on both sides of the aisle as well as school leaders. I will work with the Montana Legislature in meeting their obligation to update the formula as required by law and as mandated by our state constitution. In addition, the 3% inflationary cap has to be increased to keep pace with the inflation rate today. \n\nMy other priorities include early childhood education, recruitment and retention of teachers, helping districts meet their building and technology needs and returning the Office of Public Instruction to a respected agency that is responsive to school administrators, teachers and parents.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?",
          "answer": "First, partisan politics don’t belong in our public schools or at the Office of Public Instruction. The role of the state superintendent is to advocate on behalf of the students, educators and families in the state Legislature, the governor’s office, the Board of Public Education, and among school communities. The state superintendent must work with the Legislature and bring clarity to how policy will impact learning at the local level. It is paramount that instruction, services and resource distribution meets the diverse needs of our students with the goal that ALL students are able to learn and thrive.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?",
          "answer": "I am running for state superintendent because I know we can do better. The first order of business after being elected will be to request an independent audit of the financial and programmatic situation at OPI in order to identify major gaps and shortfalls. Rebuilding OPI’s reputation and getting the agency back on track will take hard work and focus. The complaint I hear repeatedly from school districts is that OPI is not being responsive. Not answering the phone and not providing guidance to schools is not unacceptable. Under my leadership, the OPI will be responsive and laser focused on supporting schools. Working with educators, community leaders, business owners and universities over the last 12 years, I know Montana has an abundance of talent that can be tapped to rebuild OPI. I’m ready to take on this challenge and will work tirelessly to build a culture of service and restore the pride we once all had in that office.\n"

    "summaryNarrative": "Zinke, 63 as of Election Day, has represented western Montana in Congress since last year. He says he was born in Bozeman and raised in Whitefish on a property where his family has lived for four generations. He is also a retired U.S. Navy SEAL commander.\n\nZinke served as President Donald Trump’s Secretary of the Interior from 2017 to 2018. He previously served as a state legislator and was initially elected to represent what was then a statewide congressional district in 2014.\n\nAs he campaigns for re-election this year, Zinke describes himself as a “Reagan optimist” who believes the nation’s problems can be addressed “despite the mess (President) Biden has created in our economy, border, and national security.”\n\nFederal investigations of Zinke’s tenure at the Interior department found he misled investigators [about his role in a Whitefish land deal](https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/DOI/WebReactFormerSecretaryEthicalNoncompliance.pdf) and about the department’s [decision not to act on a gaming application from two Native American tribes](https://www.doioig.gov/sites/default/files/2021-migration/WebRedacted_FormerSecretaryandCOSDidntComplyWithDutyofCandor.pdf) while serving as secretary. Zinke has criticized both investigations as politically motivated.\n\nThis biography is based on written material submitted by the Zinke campaign and past MTFP reporting.\n",

Every economist agrees — the inflation is being driven by high energy costs and years of uncontrolled government spending. We need to continue pushing legislation that recall pointless spending, cut taxes and incentivize working instead of handouts. \n\nOn immigration, I meet with county commissioners, sheriffs and tribal leadership daily. I hear over and over how the border crisis is spilling into our communities, stressing our public resources and filling our jails. One of my early votes in 2023 was for the Secure the Border Act. The House has done their jobs, the Senate has neglected theirs for more than a year by not taking it up. But the easiest solution is for the President to do his job. Biden is derelict in his duty and has ignored the constitutional authority he has to fix the crisis he’s created.\n\n"

          "answer": "Well, first I’d show Biden where Montana is on a map because he hasn’t shown up here since he got elected. Then, I’d ask for new leadership in the Departments of Interior and Transportation because both agencies are failing Montanans on every level.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I’ve got a fantastic relationship with President Trump. He knows Montana and the issues we face well. Under Trump our country was thriving economically, and we had confidence in our national security because our allies trusted us and our enemies feared us. Now, we couldn’t be in a more opposite situation with Biden in office. I look forward to working with him to make our country great again. \n\n"

          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. I sit on appropriations and my two priorities were to curve spending and remove the woke out-of-touch agenda that’s costing Americans millions. The 12 individual spending bills the committee sent to the House floor cut spending by double digits across the federal government. We cut some agencies by 40%. But cutting is not enough. We also need to grow our way out of this, and that’s where cutting red tape and regulatory reform come in. I voted for the $600 billion tax cuts package to help small businesses hit by high interest rates, encourage lower income families to get back in the workforce, and provide relief to folks just trying to buy gas, groceries and rent.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I have deep empathy for women who find themselves facing this difficult decision. I have never opposed an outright ban and I vehemently oppose efforts by the Democrats to make abortion legal up to the moment of birth. Abortion should be regulated, safe and legal in the first trimester, but policymakers must recognize that the best way to prevent abortions in the first place is to make sure contraceptives are widely available and affordable. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "When looking at the cost of housing in Montana you have to look at the big picture, that’s that under Joe Biden, every single thing is more expensive. It is also much more expensive to buy or build a home. To get home construction costs down the government needs to get inflation down, which means stop spending money we don’t have. Bring the historically high interest rates down. Open up mortgages on trailer homes. I’m also working with a bipartisan group on the Hill to expand low-interest and low-downpayment loans to first responders and K-12 educators so they can afford to live in the communities they serve. The average American is paying a $1,000 more a month for basics since Biden took office. It’s more expensive to power and heat homes because Biden’s war on American energy. We need to continue tax cuts for working families, encourage home ownership and policies that make it easier to attain a title, and give the private sector the space to bring back a competitive market.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "There is no debate the climate is changing; man is an influence. I think where there’s debate on it is what that influence is and what can and should we do about it. My view has always been that promoting clean air and clean water and reducing our dependence on foreign energy is a positive step forward. Nobody produces energy more efficiently or cleaner than right here in the United States. When I was secretary we had the biggest production year on record and it was also the best safety year and we lowered emissions. So, the answer is not to cut domestic energy production, the answer is to allow the private sector to continually innovate to make energy more sustainable and efficient while lowering costs and improving safety.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "I just got back from a visit to the southern border and one thing is for sure — there is no border. There’s checkpoints where illegal migrants go to get a shower, a meal, and a piece of paper telling them to report for a court date in six years. The executive orders Biden signed on day one reversed what we spent four years building under Trump. Biden created this crisis, as a result crime, sex trafficking, drug trafficking and fentanyl overdoses are skyrocketing in Montana. The answer is H.R. 2 —  the Secure the Border Act the House passed more than a year ago and the Senate has let collect dust since. Both the Senate and White House have the tools they need to secure the border —  but it’s going to take a Senate and White House to work with the House to get it done. \nH.R. 2\nEnds catch and release\nSupports ICE to do their jobs, \nResumes construction of the wall,\nHolds Mexico accountable\nReinstates the successful Remain in Mexico policy\n\n"

          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "The evidence is clear that Obamacare has been a failure for Montanans and health insurance plans continue to get more expensive. History has shown us that the best way to ensure affordable and accessible health care coverage is employer-sponsored coverage. Additionally, the U.S. needs to stop providing coverage to illegal aliens. It’s crushing our hospitals and clinics, stressing systems and all the costs are being pushed down to patients.\n"

He left his position as vice president of sales in 2020 and published a memoir, “Gunfight,” criticizing radicalization in the firearms industry the following year.\n\nBusse, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up on his family’s ranch in northwestern Kansas, has lived in the Flathead Valley since 1995. Busse has said his time in Montana has helped shape his identity as an environmental and conservation advocate. He previously served as a volunteer board member and board chair for both Backcountry Hunters & Anglers and Montana Conservation Voters.\n\n“My Montana is a place where hardworking people make a good living for themselves, raise their kids with equal opportunity,” Busse said in his first campaign video. “Unfortunately the Montana that I love, and that my kids have been raised in, is being threatened right now.”\n\nBusse has not previously held elected office. As he has campaigned for governor, Busse has pledged to make property taxes more equitable, stabilize school funding and protect reproductive rights and abortion access. \n\nBusse was cited for hunting birds without a license in 1998, [according to Lee Newspapers](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/ryan-busse-hunting-without-a-license-montana-governor/article_feb48cc0-7cec-11ee-abfe-178dd3bce54d.html), paying a $120 fine. He has said he made a mistake about which combination of hunting licenses he needed to purchase. \n\nThis biography is based on Busse’s memoir, responses to MTFP and his campaign materials.\n",

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services but are calculated through a system set at the state level. What if any changes to the state tax system would you support?",
          "answer": "Montanans’ concerns over Greg Gianforte’s reckless, record property tax hike on Montana homeowners is the biggest and loudest concern I hear on the campaign trail. I hear it from lifelong Republicans, even elected Republican leaders, who wonder why their wealthy governor, and his supermajority in the Montana Legislature, raised taxes on them while giving tax breaks to corporations. Gianforte also gave tax breaks to himself while increasing taxes on his neighbors! As governor, I will demand the Legislature adjust the property tax rate when home values increase to prevent the burden falling on homeowners, as previous Republican and Democratic governors have done. I also support the wealthy and corporations paying their fair share. Billionaires and millionaires who buy up third or fourth homes here should be on the hook for ensuring that our community heroes — law enforcement officers, teachers and nurses — have an opportunity to live in safe, affordable homes in the communities they serve.\n\n"

What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?",
          "answer": "Our Constitution guarantees “equality of educational opportunity” to every Montanan, and this isn’t up for debate. That means whenever schools in our state face shortfalls, we have a constitutional obligation to roll up our sleeves and find funding, without unfairly heaping the burden solely onto ordinary homeowners, and without creating chaos and uncertainty for counties, as Gov. Gianforte has recklessly done. I strongly support adequately funding all public schools in Montana with a tax system that doesn’t let the wealthy off the hook while ordinary homeowners get Gianforte’s additional tax bills. As governor, I would also never falsely blame higher property taxes on county commissioners or municipal leaders, as Gov. Gianforte has done. And unlike Gov. Gianforte, I also strongly oppose any effort to fund private or religious schools with public tax revenue.\n\n"

          "answer": "I strongly support a woman’s constitutional right to make whatever health care decisions are best for her health and her family and her future, including whether or when to have a family, without interference from any government or politician. I support a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion, which is guaranteed in our Constitution as a matter of privacy. I support strengthening those rights and freedoms. Greg Gianforte, and a handful of extremists in the Montana Legislature, are dangerously hell-bent on taking those rights and freedoms away.\n\n"

          "question": "Montana is one of the states that expanded Medicaid access under the federal Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to previously uninsured populations. As governor, would you sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form in 2025?",
          "answer": "Yes. Folding more Montanans into Medicaid coverage was a bipartisan solution that has only improved the lives and livelihood of countless people. It has provided certainty and stability in our communities — for kids, seniors and Indigenous people. And it has saved all of us money in the long term. When asked about the 133,000 Montanans who lost Medicaid coverage under Gianforte’s watch, including 36,000 children, he responded that his plan for stripping health care was “working as intended.” That kind of approach is dangerous, cruel, costly and immoral.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?",
          "answer": "Montana faces a housing crisis that Greg Gianforte has overseen, while making our state the most expensive it’s ever been. And only someone as wealthy as him would have the gall to call his own crisis “The Montana Miracle.” The first thing I’ll do as governor is to stop making the problem worse — as Gov. Gianforte has done. Look, he raised property taxes on ordinary homeowners (while cutting his own taxes) and proclaimed “Montana is a great place to sell” without doing the hard work of making our state more affordable and more livable (he has certainly not looked out for public schools, law enforcement agencies or hospitals). We must ensure that our community heroes — law enforcement officers, teachers and nurses — have an opportunity to live in safe, affordable homes in the communities they serve, and we can do that by reexamining our tax system to make sure that billionaires and millionaires (like Gianforte) who drive up home prices here are on the hook for their fair share.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?",
          "answer": "While I deeply respect the First Amendment right for all people to practice whatever faith they choose, I also believe in the First Amendment guarantee that our government respects no establishment of religion. To that end, I have significant concerns about Greg Gianforte’s efforts to fund private religious schools with public tax dollars. As governor, he wants to impose his extreme religious views on the rest of us, and I’ll fight his betrayal of our First Amendment rights at every turn.\n"

He supports decriminalizing cannabis and a ceasefire and two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. \n\n“One of Jon Tester’s greatest failures is his inaction on the continued Israeli assault on Gaza, and his refusal to support a ceasefire,” Barb wrote. “I’m running for the United States Senate to provide an alternative for the hundreds of thousands of Montanans who want to see an end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and an end to war.”\n\nBarb did not respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire.

He also said he is passionate about railroad safety. He said his remote work with health care provider Altera as an interface analyst has familiarized him with the sort of specialized, complex work he would enjoy doing as a commissioner. He added that serving if elected, serving on the PSC would be his full-time job.\n\n“I'm environmentally conscious, as are most people who live and work around the agricultural industry, but I approach it from a reasonable point of view,” Elwood said. \n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP interview with Elwood and his response to an MTFP questionnaire.\n",

          "question": "What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?",
          "answer": "There is not one specific issue troubling eastern Montana but a kaleidoscope of several issues. It is my observation that the border crisis, agriculture, natural resource development, inflation and home purchase prices share a top priority type of interest with Montana voters. One thing is for sure: In every corner of the district the open border policy of the Democrats seems to irritate people the most. There are thousands of people streaming illegally across the border daily. We are giving these illegal aliens all sorts of free benefits, like free debit cards, cell phones, health care, education and hotel accommodations. Don’t forget that they also get a free ride to their favorite sanctuary city for even more benefits. The border needs to be closed first and then we can negotiate a new immigration policy. Those who have already illegally crossed the border need to be sent back. We cannot afford to take in all these people on the backs of the American taxpayer.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?",

        },
        {
          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?",
          "answer": "Let's hope that does not happen. He is totally out of it mentally. At any rate, I respect the position and if he wins, he will certainly deserve my respect as our president. Once the election is over it is time to get to work for the American citizens that elected us. All of our efforts should be focused on America and not so much with bickering between all the members.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I do support former President Trump for president. I am willing to listen to his ideas and give him support to get his time-tested policies passage. I never imagined that he would be able to get so much done as he did the first four years. Inflation was low, interest rates were low, the jobs report always showed good results and the farm bills were always supported by President Trump. I never would have believed that a man from New York City could help and support Montana farmers to the degree that he did. I will give him all the support he needs to get the southern border crisis under control.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "We have about a $35 trillion U.S. debt to service. Congress needs to take the steps now to bring down the debt level. We are broke by any business standards. The U.S. government takes in about $5 trillion a year in tax revenue. At this point the best way to start getting a handle on our spending habits is to stop increasing our spending. No new programs. We can't even afford what we have already committed to in the past. We sure could cut national public radio, endowment for the arts, free cell phones, debit cards, hotel rooms, health care and education to illegal aliens. I don't get any of that stuff free myself, why should an illegal alien get it?\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I have always been endorsed by the Right to Life organization. I will continue to support the efforts to save babies from being killed. In this case the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken, and they say it is a state right issue. So let the states handle it and we should step back and see how it goes for a few years.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Congress can work to support the development of our natural resources industry, which will in turn stimulate the economy with new job growth and consumption of American products. We need to drill and use our own American oil to fuel our economy. Once we begin rebuilding our energy sector then the economy will get much better and the value of our dollar will regain strength and purchasing power. This is how you lift everyone up in a modern economy. A strong economy makes everything more affordable.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "I don't view climate change as an urgent issue. There is no amount of tax dollars you can spend to stop the climate from changing if in fact it is changing. Science now shows that when Al Gore declared that the East Coast was going to be flooded by 2020, it in fact did not happen. The shoreline is exactly where it has always been as confirmed by satellite photos. Pollution that is manmade is something that we can control. Let's make more of an effort to tackle an issue like that and the complications that our city landfills are facing.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "To me there is a simple answer. Shut the border down from illegal alien crossings, build the wall, stop paying out all the freebies and send the non-profits home. Gather up as many of these people that illegally crossed the border that we can find and ship them back to where they entered the US. What the Democrats have allowed to happen is a crime against all of us taxpayers and our children that will be paying for this debacle for the rest of their adult lives.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "I never supported Obamacare. The day that bill passed was the day my health insurance premiums began to increase uncontrollably. I was told by the Democrats that I would be able to keep using my doctor and my premiums were not going to increase. They were clearly wrong. My bill from Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield rose from $450 per month to $1,700 just before I canceled the plan. I ended up getting coverage from a unfunded Christian health care cost share policy. It is working and now I understand that the Democrats do not like Christian health care companies. Let's repeal Obamacare and let the free market go out and price the product in a competitive atmosphere.\n"

          "question": "What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?",
          "answer": "Housing. Having traveled tens of thousands of miles in my minivan connecting with people, the issue people everywhere want solved is housing. Students are worried about the high cost of rent, homeowners are worried about rising property taxes and seniors are increasingly unable to find space in nursing homes.\n\nI’ve held workshops on housing across the district. Our communities have thoughtful, innovative ideas to address housing, but they need support from federal partners.\n\nCongress can impact housing policy through policies such as: changes in the tax code; removing the permanent chassis requirement for manufactured homes; offering incentives that promote housing construction in high-demand regions; aligning policies that affect transportation, water, and sewer with housing production; and redefining “affordable” so middle class families have access to programs that can help them afford to buy or rent a home. Sen. Tester has proposed solutions that I would advance in the House.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?",
          "answer": "Jon Tester. Sen. Tester has been an effective legislator for Montana, and instrumental in investing in Montana through projects like the Tech Hub designation that led to growth of a local optics and photonics industry bringing good jobs to Montana; Kagy Boulevard in Bozeman, the PACT Act for veterans that helps people here get care they need, and the 93 bypass in Kalispell. Sen. Tester has pushed for enactment of legislation like the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act and the Montana Headwaters Legacy Act, advancing homegrown solutions to help local issues on the ground. \n\nI will be a partner in the House to help get these kinds of bills across the finish line.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?",
          "answer": "My first priority is always to do right by Montana. I will work respectfully with everyone, regardless of party, to make sure that the necessary work gets done, but I will also take on anyone whose actions hurt Montanans. I will work with the administration to get inflation under control and increase the supply of housing that people can afford in our state. Housing costs are a growing concern across the country, and I will work with anyone to champion this issue and make housing more affordable.\n\nI will work with the administration to defend our privacy and freedom, and will work to protect the right for all women to choose when and how they start their family.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I have spent my career working to bring people together to tackle hard problems. I will take that same approach to D.C. and work with whoever is in office to fight for Montanans. I will work respectfully with everyone, regardless of party, to make sure that the necessary work gets done, but I will also take on anyone whose actions hurt Montanans.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "Yes. A first step is making sure that those who have benefited the most from the American economy pay some taxes — the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthiest and biggest multinational corporations should be allowed to expire. That alone will go a long way to reining in the deficit. We must also surgically cut government waste where it exists while ensuring we take care of our veterans, children, the elderly, and invest in our future.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I stand by the privacy and freedom that we are guaranteed as Americans to make the most personal decisions about our lives without government interference, and support legislation that protects that constitutional privacy and freedom. As the mother of three daughters, I trust women and their families to make the most private decisions in their lives — including when, whether and with whom to become a parent. In Congress I will fight to protect Montanans' freedoms, including the right to make private decisions about abortion and IVF fertility treatments, so families in Montana have the freedom to decide when and how they choose to start their families, without government mandates and intrusion. I will support legislation that restores the freedoms protected by Roe v. Wade. \n\nI will never let the government interfere with our most basic, fundamental freedom to make the private decisions about who we love, whether we have a family, and how we live. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "It’s simply unacceptable that school teachers, saw mill workers, nurses and lifelong Montanans can’t afford a home, as more and more Montanans are being squeezed out. \n\nSolving the housing crisis requires all elected representatives to engage together. Congress can support: use of mass timber; addressing restrictions to unlock supply of manufactured homes; adjusting cost of living and Area Median Income to reflect local realities; increasing trade school programs to bring more local workers into the industry; more directly funding local government through programs grants; raising the threshold on qualified census tract criteria for LIHTC and expand the program to include higher wage earners to target key employees like teachers, police, fire, nurses; removing incentives to own multiple homes, such as removing tax deductibility of second homes and taxing corporate ownership of multiple housing stock; and supporting legislation that Sen. Tester is working on, including the PRICE act.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Drought, increased wildfire, and decreased snowpack are urgent issues we must address now. The energy transition is here, and Montana can be a leader in investing in Montana while taking advantage of our incredible resources and growing our economy. We can streamline the transmission process, consider all options for energy that have zero carbon emissions, and develop distributed generation to ensure energy resilience, freedom, and security in our communities that will define our economy in the next 20 years. Western Montana has the resources and infrastructure to lead this economic growth. \n\nMy experience working in the energy world, working on projects from soup to nuts, representing landowners, project developers, off takers and advocating for farmers, ranchers, energy producers and everyday Montanans makes me a powerful voice for Montana in Congress. We can secure a livable future for all by investing in the energy transition and making sure Montana’s resources benefit Montanans.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "Secure the border and make sure there is a legal process for immigration that works. The Bipartisan Border Security bill in the Senate was a real step forward that would allow us to immediately shut down the border if it becomes overwhelmed, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, and crack down on the flow of fentanyl. The bill was endorsed by the men and women in the Border Patrol on the front lines. In Congress, I will work to secure our border and protect Montanans. I will never play politics with our safety.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "I will support legislation to protect Montanans access to care and make sure they can afford it. Some steps I would take include making sure the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act is fully funded and followed, ensuring that Medicaid expansion remains intact, addressing the costs of prescription drugs as was done with the legislation that implemented $35 insulin, protecting veterans by supporting legislation like the PACT Act, listening to our Native Americans and acting to make sure they get health care in the communities they live in; addressing costs of transport for health care and making sure they are covered when necessary; making sure nursing home costs are covered so our nursing homes remain open.\n\nRural hospitals in our state also depend on Medicaid expansion and maintaining the program is crucial to ensuring our hospitals can keep their doors open. I will fight to protect Medicare and the expansion of Medicaid to ensure our Montana communities are safe and stable.\n"

          "answer": "AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE\nI strongly support policies that prioritize both affordability and excellence in Montana’s health care system. The worrying closure of nursing homes, rural hospitals and the lack of mental health care access to essential services in underserved areas and to expand Medicare prescription drug coverage right now. These actions are essential to alleviate financial burdens on our elderly and at-risk populations, and on the taxpayers who are footing the bill for expensive and preventable services.\n\nFurthermore, it is important that we untie the hand of health care providers and finally empower them to make diagnostic decisions with the best interest of their patients, instead of asking them to spend their precious time negotiating with bureaucrats who hold the purse strings. Upholding these principles requires concrete policy initiative at improving access, affordability and quality of care statewide.\n\n"

He was the Senate majority leader who was able work across the aisle with members of the Republican Party. He came from humble beginnings as a worker in the Butte mines to being admired and respected to lead Congress through some very difficult times. He was a quiet leader and left our state legislation with laws and regulations to protect our environment but also an era of economic growth for Montana. \n\n"

          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?",
          "answer": "I will continue to support the work of President Biden with the bipartisan bill Infrastructure Reduction Act to build the necessary programs of Montana with internet needs of the cities and towns of Montana. I will support the passing of the Farm Bill 2025 and push for more reforms in prescription drug coverage and for improved amendments to Medicare. I plan to work to improve the lives of the people of Montana and to listen and vote those on venues which continues to improve the safety our nations well-being.\n\n"

I will be able vote on the feasibility of these projects and make sure outcomes and goals are possible. If he is president I will respect his stature as president and work across the aisle for the welfare of our nation and Montana.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "We need to make sure everyone pays there fair share. The ability of corporate taxes and owners have been able to find tax loopholes that have made the federal deficit a problem.\n\nI recognize the federal deficit continues to grow and the overspending need to stop. Since the Congress is the beginning of the budget I will continually make sure those programs on the docket are reasonable and not part of a pork barrel favoring. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "As a degree holder in biology with years of experience in the medical field, my stance on reproductive rights is shaped by both academic and professional knowledge and compassionate humanity. Working in a hospital in the Philippines, I witnessed the  consequences of restrictive abortion laws, where women faced life-threatening situations and the loss of both maternal and fetal lives. \n\nIt is not the government’s role to pry into our private medical records or to make moral decisions about women’s health care. I firmly believe that women are perfectly capable of making these deeply personal decisions for themselves, and as a candidate for public office, I am committed to opposing legislation that would limit a woman’s right to choose and actively supporting measures that codify this fundamental right once and for all. Everyone deserves the autonomy to make decisions about our own bodies, and it is my pledge to stand firm in ensuring that this right is protected and upheld.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Montana, like many parts of our nation, is facing a housing affordability crisis, leaving far too many families struggling to find safe and affordable housing. This crisis is not only impacting individuals and families but also our communities and economy. Here are some potential approaches that I believe could make a real difference. We need Congress to address investing in housing initiatives, promoting homeownership opportunities, limiting corporate ownership of residential property, addressing zoning and regulatory barriers and supporting sustainable housing solutions. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "As a man with the privilege of experience both in the oil fields of Eastern Montana and the lecture halls of medical school, I have developed a strong preference for no-nonsense, scientific, evidence-based decision making. I am committed to preserving our planet for future generations. I advocate for investment in renewable energy to ensure Montana remains at the forefront of innovation. I support incentivizing lower emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nI recognize the significance of support to communities reliant on fossil fuels, whose labor has contributed to Montana’s economic strength and made discussions about a clean, sustainable future financially feasible. It is essential to balance environmental conservation with the well-being of communities impacted by these policies, striving for solutions benefiting all parties while addressing the challenges of climate change. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "A short-term solution to secure the border is to hire more patrols, increase the amount of immigration judges, and improve the gateway areas at border crossings.\n\nFor some long term solutions to the border is to work with the Organization of American States to use their data in countries to screen immigrants that seek asylum. We need to look at the nations with the most people coming to the border as San Salvador, Venezuela and Cuba and find economic ways to improve their hardships in their nations and try to seek economic help in improving some of the catastrophes they are facing. Also, countries as Cuba or Venezuela, begin to negotiate in lifting embargos for trade. Another avenue to improve with our South American nations is to find amendments in the USMCA trade agreement for a more robust economic venue between Mexico, Canada and the United States. With these types of programs many of those who are leaving their countries may begin to find prosperity without traveling. \n\n"

        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "I would support lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 50 to extend health care coverage to a larger portion of the population. The success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has shown the need. Extending Medicare coverage to individuals aged 50 and above would ensure that more people have access to comprehensive health care services, including preventive care, treatment for chronic conditions, and financial protection from health care costs.\n\nI would support enabling Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Also, I support  addressing high provider prices in health care. Monopolistic practices can limit competition, drive up costs and reduce patient choice. Streamlining administrative paperwork would not only alleviate the burden on health care providers but also allow them to focus more on patient care and less on administration. By tackling integration, high prescription prices, and administrative inefficiencies, we can make real progress toward a more equitable system.\n"

Crony capitalism, corruption in government to include Congress and people in power throughout our government that never seem to be held accountable. Much of this can be corrected with a balance budget amendment similar to the one that Jon Tester voted against in 2011. Our country holds the position of being in control of the reserve currency of the world. Our leadership has debased our currency by borrowing $35 trillion. This must stop. It is at the core of the corruption. It is also at the core of inflation, the most insidious tax on poor people. We must insist on a balanced budget amendment, restrict any person over the age of 74 from serving in the Federal government, and term limits of 12 years in Congress. We need voting laws that are beyond reproach. We need a federal clearing house for candidates so the voter can be well informed, and the candidates held responsible for what they say.\n"

The problem with old people is they forget what they tell people, and they are the last to know when it's time to quit. Just like George W. Bush said no more nation building when he was running for office, that didn't work out for the people. Our Senate is evenly split, giving each senator a unique position of power. The Senate confirms the presidents appointments to cabinet positions. I will not confirm any cabinet officer that will not answer direct questions with direct answers. The same for federal judges. I am not partisan, my only loyalty is to the people, and the country. I am of the opinion that Joe Biden is past his prime and that he should step aside and let Kamala Harris become president. He said she was qualified. This is the time to find out, we the people need to know.\n"

          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "In many ways Donald Trump provides evidence of his narcissism just like Joe Biden does. His ability to make cabinet appointments is also suspect. Ryan Zinke was no better prepared for interior secretary than the tiny little electrical company in his hometown that he was trying to hire to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid. The president must work with Congress. Congress does not seek his approval, but he must seek our approval. The more independent a senator is from his party, the greater the influence he will have on the process. Jon Tester operates in lockstep with the Democrat leadership and that is why he has been ineffectual after 18 years. He refused to work with Donald Trump, nothing’s changed. There are things I can work on with Trump. Such as the southern border and immigration control. Maybe we can get our balanced budget amendment. We must move our country forward.\n"

          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "Please do not mischaracterize these statements. They are a starting point for negotiation on very important issues. Social Security and Medicare are currently not part of the deficit. They do need reform, they will be insolvent in less than nine years. We currently borrow approximately half of what we spend each year. Everything must be visited. We must stop lying to our people so they can rise to the occasion and understand the problems our current leadership has put us in. I support both, spending cuts and tax increases. It will take bold honest discussions and debates open to the public to resolve this issue. Either way there are dark days ahead of us. This will be our moment as a nation to come together and like our founding fathers we must make changes now to guide our country into the future and protect the Republic. A key component of this will be returning sovereignty and responsibility to the states. Sacrifices will be required, it is unthinkable not to succeed.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "There have been many opportunities since 1973 for both parties to fix this problem. Neither one of them wanted to lose abortion as a wedge issue to drive us apart. While the Supreme Court provided pro choice with the opportunity to compromise with pro life and craft a piece of legislation both could live with, it was wasted. Now pro life is in the driver seat and it is unlikely they will craft a bill to compromise with pro choice. My starting point on the issue would be no state should restrict a woman's right to have an abortion in the first trimester. Rape and incest carve out. If two doctors are willing to sign off on an unviable pregnancy up to the sixth month, it should be granted. This should be a baseline and beyond this each state should have complete control of the abortion issue. It is unlikely the federal government will ever get involved with abortion based on past performance. It is now a states’ rights issue. It will remain so until the Supreme Court takes it up again.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "The federal government should not get involved in affordable housing. Affordable housing is a regional problem. Best solved by the states. The federal government is in debt over $34 trillion. The federal government does not have money to spend on another issue. I was listening to the California Senate debate. Rep. Barbara Lee stated that if she won the Senate seat she would get $100 billion of funding for much-needed housing in California. Now you know why we are $34 trillion in debt. What Congress can do to affect the housing crisis is simply to balance the budget. This would drive inflation down and stabilize the cost of interest to purchase a home. Everything is interlinked. We have a housing shortage, yet we leave our southern border open and invite 9 million people into our country. We could drive the cost of building a house down if we harvested more timber instead of letting it burn.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Climate change is real, but it will most likely not be the cause of our extinction. Congress has not gotten anything right in the last 80 years, so why would you think they know what they're talking about this time. Keeling is responsible for the first carbon dioxide measurements of the atmosphere in 1958. It measured 313 ppm and is currently at 414 ppm. That's only 25% increase of our current carbon dioxide level in 66 years. I suspect the reason they are using this as the bogeyman to try and scare us is simply because Congress doesn't blame any one particular industry beyond transportation for the problem. Transportation uses only 15% of the total petroleum products. Pollution is the bigger problem that Congress does not want to address. Instead Congress has assisted our corporations in shipping the pollution overseas. There are over 1 million abandoned oil wells spewing methane that is 28 times more toxic to the environment than carbon dioxide. This is a threat to our environment.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "This has been a problem for my entire life. We must seal the southern border completely. We need to re-examine all of our refugee and immigration programs. Immigration is a three to one loss for the federal government and state agencies. We simply do not have the money to support an immigrant population. It's not about compassion it's about common sense. We the people of this country have a culture. It has eroded due to bad policies of our federal government. Our government needs to stop sanctioning countries in an effort to destroy their economies. This does not make our people safer it just makes our politicians more powerful and dangerous. This is behavior that must be corrected in our state department. Middle East condition since 9/11 2001 are a prime example. Only a fool or politician would say it's a safer place. We have destroyed entire nations with our intervention. We must bring all of our military home to protect our boarders and the American people.\n"

        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "In 2000 a family of four's health care was about $6500 per year, 2010 affordable health care act was passed. At that time insurance was approximately $12,500. In 2020 it had increased by over $10,000 a year. That certainly does not seem very affordable to me. We still have tens of millions uninsured. A document, 1,000s of pages controlling our health care, Congress and Jon Tester did not read it. When Trump was president Tester could've revisited the problem, but he just voted no on repealing it. The medical industry reports record profits at the expense of the people. I cannot think of one thing that Congress has managed well. For this reason single-payer scares the hell out of me. If we are to balance our budget and move our country forward then everything must be examined. I do not have the answer for this one, yet. One thing is for sure, we must get it right this time. Other countries have models that we can explore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?",
          "answer": "We should allow our military industrial complex to sell arms to countries in order to protect their borders. It should be controlled by Congress. The keyword is sell, not provide them with the money to purchase. If we are to save our country from economic chaos and therefore the world from economic chaos. We must stop the policy of interfering in other countries issues. There have been more people killed in the past 60 years because of our intervention. It is a contributor to our $34 trillion debt. We should revisit every treaty we are involved in. Some will stand and some will need to be renegotiated. We need a strong navy, a well-trained expeditionary force, and a domestic force designed for the defense of our nation. We must harden our space and cyber defense. Once our debt has been paid off in full we can revisit helping other countries. We have a responsibility to our country to provide peace and tranquility within our borders.\n"

As your congresswoman, I will use the power of the purse to defund our government until our border is shut. I will fight for limited and accountable government, Second Amendment rights and the sanctity of life. I will stand up to the ruling elite who are destroying the American way of life and all that has made our country great by taking away our liberty; by undermining our nation’s elections; and by pushing radical race and gender ideology in our schools, boardrooms and media. I will fight for Montana's water rights and logging rights. I will fight against tax hikes. I will say NO to manipulation used to cause fear, like pandemics and global warming. If we as Americans continue to abandon the principals that have made us the greatest and freest nation in the world and refuse to recognize the internal and external threats, we are sowing seeds of our own destruction.\n"

Bushman formerly worked for Sibanye-Stillwater, the South Africa-based owner of the Stillwater and East Boulder platinum and palladium mines in southern Montana. \n\nBushman said he’s running for another term on the PSC because he was asked to by people concerned about the commission and because he’d like to encourage better decision-making in government for the sake of his four children.\n\nBushman told MTFP that he would like to ensure that there is a “fair playing field” between renewable power generators and the utilities buying power from them. He said the commission is tasked with applying regulations laid out in state and federal laws, not writing regulations, and there is no place for considering climate change in the commission’s work.\n\n“I will push back on the agendas of the environmentalists using federal policy to push costly technology that doesn’t solve the challenges of today,” he said. \n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP interview with Bushman, Bushman’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and election information from Ballotpedia.\n",

          "question": "What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?",
          "answer": "Protecting democracy and our right to vote our leaders into office. Immediately followed by fair taxation/no inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. In many cases, as an example, corporations are a greater burden on our publicly-funded infrastructure and paying a fair share is the American way. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families and place large corporations in a tax bracket that is more reflective of their heavier use of public infrastructure than the average citizen. \n\n"

          "question": "Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?",
          "answer": "Jasmine Crockett of Texas. There are very few people in Congress, current and past, that I truly admire, but more and more I’m seeing people my age and younger who are bringing fire to the firefight and making a difference, and Rep. Crockett is a star. Her wit, her cadence, her style and her inability to tolerate fools is something we need. She’s sharp and well-informed, ready and willing to do the work but will call out unacceptable idiocy in open conversation. There are no smoke and mirrors on her watch. I look forward to working with her.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?",
          "answer": "The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Plan already passed by the Biden administration are good blueprints for what we need to do next. We need to, and President Biden has asked for, an expansion of the child tax credit. We can invest in first-time home buying programs, microgeneration of electricity and regulate fair sale rates back to the grid. We can expand our infrastructure investments to massively expand broadband, high-speed rail, airport, sea ports and shipping infrastructure. We can advance the goals of clean air, clean water, manage wildlife and expand our public lands, and still have businesses making money and growing our economy. We need to remind investors that investing in the tech for wind and solar will pay off both monetarily and socially in the future. And while I agree with many Biden policies, I don’t agree 100% of the time, and I’d work with the administration as much as possible to make sure that where we don’t agree we also do no harm.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I make no bones about the fact that I disagree with Mr. Trump on far more items than I agree with him, but that doesn’t mean it’s 100%, and just like with President Biden, I’d work to make sure that where we disagree we do no harm, and where we agree we work together to improve the lives of all Americans. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "I would aim to drive economic growth, create fair taxation and establish fair compensation rules to reduce the federal deficit. We should be investing in education as the fastest way out of the deficit is innovations.\n\nFair taxation/No inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families. \n\nFair compensation. Over the last five decades the playing field has tilted wildly in favor of the few ultra-wealthy and it’s time to level the playing field. We need to cap executive pay in relation to the pay of frontline workers. And, unions are the fastest way to regular wage increases so get a union.\n\nEconomic growth. Montana is the #1 state for entrepreneurs. We have a long, proud history of being hard workers and smart creators. We have the space to build things, including more housing, and transport things manufactured as we have the routes to distribute them.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I would support federal legislation that guarantees that all women will have access to health care, including abortion, on a national basis. It’s 2024 and I can’t believe we’re having to explain this to a whole national party, but women are human and deserve full human rights.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Making sure that first-time buyers have access to loans at good interest rates is important, and that we are investing money into growing communities to expand their housing inventory. That also means making sure that the majority of housing is available to homebuyers as opposed to private equity and for investment purposes so we’re reasonably ensuring housing availability for families without being in competition with for-profit operations. The credit score regulations are stacked against people, especially those in their 20s and 30s. We need to adjust the regulations on credit scores so rental history counts towards your ability to qualify for a loan, and not using a credit card has a positive impact on your score rather than impacting your score negatively. \nAdditionally, reducing the wage gap at every business will improve things for everyone, while fighting greedflation and the price gouging that’s currently driving up the costs of living for everyone will help.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Science says we have 10 years. We’ve all watched as winters have gotten warmer and less snow has fallen. In Montana we have the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment. We that enshrined for every U.S. citizen. In Montana we have a deep love for our outdoor heritage. We can take advantage of our healthful environment, by encouraging active family lifestyles via walkable communities, which would also reduce the emissions that threaten the landscapes we love. Public lands are a precious resource as land availability is finite. To maintain open spaces we should encourage the creation of community development with smart density population growth rather than disconnected suburban sprawl. Addressing climate change is also a necessity for the rural livelihood of our farmers and ranchers because sudden and/or extreme weather events caused by climate change can devastate crops and significantly change the care needed (and cost involved) in raising crops to a successful harvest.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "The security needed at our southern border is, in part, a symptom of immigration laws that are too complicated. The immigration system needs to be improved upon significantly and treating people with humanity should not take a backseat to any other interest. Reducing the over-adversarial stance of our immigration policy, combined with funding the research and investigative arms, will mean faster ways for good people to move here, which will ultimately help us grow.\n\nNone of this happens without the funding and authorization to do so, and that comes from Congress getting its act together and actually passing comprehensive border reform. We can do this. It takes time and dedication and elected officials who are interested in finding solutions. It takes someone like me, a fighter who knows when not to fight.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "Health literally equates to wealth so the healthier we are as a country, the wealthier we will all be and our overall economy will be stronger as well. Medicare should be expanded to everyone as a public option, and Medicare and Medicaid must be allowed, like all other health care insurers, to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on the costs of treatments. We’ve seen lives improve when people have access to affordable, quality health care. Healthy people stay healthy because they aren’t afraid a regular check-up is going to bankrupt them. Healthy people with access to preventative care are also able to focus their energy on careers and business ideas, rather than struggling to be well. It’s well past time that we all agree that making sure someone can see a doctor when a little issue arises without fear of losing their jobs or facing bankruptcy, is better than having someone wait till they need to hit the ER for help.\n"

If we do not get the out-of-control spending the future of our country is at risk. Congress must pass a balanced budget provision. Congress must also adopt single issue spending bills and term limits as way to address this issue that we cannot put off any longer. \n\n"

          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "Yes, of the utmost priority. Congress must first pass a balanced budget provision as a long-term fix. We must also stop sending our money overseas. The alphabet agencies like the FBI, CIA, NSA should all have massive budget cuts. The U.S. military needs to become more cost conscious. Also, we need to be sending our education dollars directly to the states instead of spending so much on federal bureaucracy. There is plenty to cut. \n\n"

          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I am pro-life. I have voted for all pro-life bills in the Montana Legislature and will do the same in Congress. I also believe in federalism and the states should be determining their laws.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Congress must pass a balanced budget provision. Spending money the government does not have is causing inflation to spiral out of control, making things more expensive for Montanans. A balanced budget provision will stop Congress from continuing unsustainable spending and will lower inflation, making housing more affordable. \n\n"

        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "Congress must secure the border now! This includes closing the gaps in the southern border wall, ending catch and release, bringing back the “remain in Mexico” policy. There should not be any more free flights, debit cards, and New York City hotel rooms for people coming across; it is incentivizing border crossings and must end. Congress must also reform the legal immigration system to a merit-based system that allows people to enter who will assimilate and be an asset to the U.S., not a drain on it.\n\n"

          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "The federal government needs to move towards more preventative medicine research instead of a \"sick-care\" system that is only concerned about healing the current disease. By focusing on disease prevention, it will reduce the amount of time people are in the hospital due to disease. To do this, we must adopt my bill I passed in Montana to expand medical right-to-try, shift NIH funding to age-related disease prevention, and reform the FDA towards innovation and efficacy.\n"

I approach each case with an open mind, basing decisions on the facts and applicable legal principles presented, rather than on personal beliefs or external pressures. I adhere strictly to the 1972 Montana Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and established legal precedents and statutes. My long-standing practice is to administer justice fairly, efficiently and without prejudice, promoting both community and economic stability. A good justice understands that the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government that primarily functions as an appellate court, reviewing district court cases on appeal and applications for writs and ensuring that court decisions are fair and constitutional. Additionally, a good justice recognizes the role of the judiciary in keeping the other two branches of government in check. A bad justice fails to grasp these fundamental principals.\n\n"

The Montana Supreme Court's decisions profoundly impact everyday Montanans every day, making it crucial to have justices with the integrity, fortitude, and commitment to uphold our Constitution, to protect and defend our Montana values and rights, and to keep the judiciary fair and impartial. With 38 years of combined legal and judicial experience, I am fully prepared to meet that commitment.\n\n"

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services but are calculated through a system set at the state level. What if any changes to the state tax system would you support?",
          "answer": "Montanabudget.org has a clear explanation of this in their \"The Great Tax Shift\" article. Eventually we should eliminate taxes wherever possible, but in the short term we should undo the shift from commercial to residential taxpayers that hurts Montana families to benefit big businesses. The Legislature has to do this — the governor's office doesn't have the authority.\n\n"

          "question": "Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?",
          "answer": "A nominal 3% increase per year is silly. Inflation is not fixed at 3%. If they want to reduce education spending, the Legislature should be honest and actually do it. If they want to keep pace with inflation, they should do that. The half-measure increase is nonsensical. \n\nRegardless of funding, I'd like to see more decisions made by teachers and parents and fewer by one-size-fits-all decisions made in Helena and D.C.\n\n"

          "question": "Montana maintains largely unencumbered legal access to abortion as a result of the state Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Montana Constitution’s right of privacy, even as other states restrict when and how patients can terminate their pregnancies. What are your priorities regarding abortion access?",
          "answer": "The state should make no law prohibiting or restricting access to abortion. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Montana is one of the states that expanded Medicaid access under the federal Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to previously uninsured populations. As governor, would you sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form in 2025?",
          "answer": "Medicaid expansion requires more government spending, which requires taxes, and we should reduce taxes. All government spending on health care distorts the market for health care. But cutting Medicaid in a vacuum does nothing to restore market efficiencies to health care, and I wouldn't waste a veto on such a bill, if it came across my desk.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?",
          "answer": "The Legislature should immediately reduce residential property owners' bills and restore the historical balance between commercial and residential property taxes. Going forward the Legislature should reduce and eliminate taxes wherever possible. \n\nThe DLI's building codes program should eliminate restrictions which increase construction costs, allowing increased housing supply at lower prices for homeowners and renters.\n\nThe state government does not control local zoning, which should be left to cities and counties. \n\n"

That I lack ambition more than any other trait is my chief qualification.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Ophus.\n",

    "summaryNarrative": "Tester, 68 as of Election Day, is seeking a fourth term in 2024.\n\nA self-described “three-fingered dirt farmer” who still works the family land outside of Big Sandy, Tester positions himself as a champion of rural America and multigenerational “Montana values.”\n\nBut he’s also a shrewd politician and capable fundraiser who has repeatedly defied the odds in otherwise Republican-leaning Montana. Now, he’s the influential chair of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.\n\n“Montana needs somebody back in Washington, D.C., who understands rural America. Someone who fights for our freedoms and goes to bat for our veterans, our family farms and ranches, our working families, our health care workers and our teachers,” Tester said.\n\nTester positions himself as a moderate willing to work with or oppose either Trump or Biden depending on the issue, though Republican critics note he still votes with the Democratic president the overwhelming majority of the time ([though less often than most other Democrats](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-congress-votes/jon-tester/)).  \n\nHe says he supports reducing federal spending and protecting access to abortion. He [voted for](https://www.tester.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/tester-statement-on-vote-to-secure-the-southern-border/) the 2024 bipartisan immigration and foreign aid bill that the majority of the Senate Republican caucus blocked.\n\nHe has also expressed concern about Montana’s rising cost of living. \n\n“Simply put, the Montana we know and love is changing,” Tester said. “Everything from housing to groceries is more expensive as out-of-state multimillionaires move here and buy up our land, using Montana as their personal playground. With so much changing, we’ve got to have somebody in the Senate who’s willing to fight for our Montana way of life.”\n\nThis biography is based on material Tester provided to MTFP as well as prior MTFP coverage of his campaign.\n",

          "answer": "Simply put, the Montana we know and love is changing. Everything from housing to groceries is more expensive as out-of-state multimillionaires move here and buy up our land, using Montana as their personal playground. With so much changing, we’ve got to have somebody in the Senate who’s willing to fight for our Montana way of life. \n\nI still farm the land just outside of Big Sandy that my grandparents homesteaded more than 100 years ago. I feel those changes that are going on in Montana right now, every day. \n\nMontana needs somebody back in Washington, D.C. who understands rural America. Someone who fights for our freedoms and goes to bat for our veterans, our family farms and ranches, our working families, our health care workers and our teachers. I’m running to keep up the fight for those folks, and to make sure our kids and grandkids can grow up in the same Montana we know and love. Montana is the greatest state in the greatest country in the world and it’s damn sure not for sale.\n"

          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?",
          "answer": "My most important job is listening to the voices of Montanans and bringing their perspectives back with me to Washington. I’ll take on anyone from any party — including Joe Biden — to do what’s right for Montana. \n\nThere have been times when I’ve worked with him because it helps Montana, like getting my Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill passed to fix roads, bridges, and airports across the state and get internet access into our rural communities. Other times, I’ve stood up to Biden, like demanding he keep Title 42 in place to secure our southern border, and protecting funding for our hunter safety classes after the administration tried to block it. And I worked with Republicans to protect veterans’ Second Amendment rights. My votes are never about toeing the party line — they’re about what’s best for Montana. \n\nWe live in the greatest state in the greatest country on Earth, and I’ll fight for what’s best for Montana no matter who the president is.\n"

        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "When Donald Trump was president, I worked with him to get things done for Montana and he signed more than 20 of my bills into law to help veterans, crack down on government waste and abuse, and support our first responders. If we’re both elected this November, that’s what I’ll continue to do. \n\nI have worked alongside President Trump to pass important legislation like my MISSION Act, which overhauled the VA’s disastrous Choice Program and cut down on bureaucracy so veterans didn’t have to deal with red tape and could get vital care quicker. I was also proud that President Trump signed into law my bills to audit key governmental programs to crack down on fraud and abuse, get critical resources to our rural fire departments across Montana, and protect the East Rosebud river system that south-central Montana knows and loves.\n\nNo matter who sits in the White House, I’ll work with them to deliver for Montana, because we live in the greatest state in the greatest country on Earth.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "The deficit is out of control and both parties are to blame. In Montana, we know how to balance a budget and live within our means. That is why I authored a balanced budget proposal. It would protect Social Security and Medicare benefits that our seniors have earned while still forcing the federal government to stop racking up the debt and passing it along to our kids and grandkids. We also need to hold massive corporations accountable and make them pay their fair share.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I do not support a federal ban on abortion.\n\nMontanans of all stripes don’t want the federal government telling them what to do, and they don’t want politicians or judges stripping away their personal freedoms. Just last year, politicians in Montana ignored the voices of the voters and passed abortion bans. I oppose these bans and will always fight to protect Montana women’s freedom to make their own health care decisions.\n\nThe last time I ran for reelection, Roe v. Wade had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. Now, those protections are gone — and the attacks on women’s freedoms and privacy are just beginning. I fought in the Senate to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would have enshrined the protections of Roe v. Wade into law. \n\nWe’re also seeing attacks on basic fertility treatment like IVF across the country, like when an Alabama court ruling forced IVF clinics to cancel their appointments. I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that never happens in Montana.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "As a third generation Montanan, I am worried about what is happening to our state. Our local infrastructure is severely strained, and housing costs are skyrocketing. I am deeply concerned about the housing crisis in Montana, which is forcing families to make tough choices about family homes they’ve owned for decades. Out-of-state millionaires are coming here and buying up our land and using Montana as their personal playground. You shouldn’t need to leave your hometown to get a good-paying job, and you shouldn’t need a million bucks to keep a good roof over your head. \n\nMontana isn’t for sale. I recently introduced a bill to establish a manufactured housing community improvement grant program, to help revitalize Montana’s affordable housing supply. I will continue pushing for my Rural Housing Service Reform Act to improve federal rural housing programs. We need to continue investing in affordable housing programs. I’ll never stop fighting to protect working Montana families.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "There is no question about it, climate change is impacting our economy and our way of life. Sharla and I see these impacts firsthand on our farm, where significant droughts have led to some of the toughest harvests in recent years. \n\nWe should be developing clean energy technologies to tackle climate change, create good-paying American jobs, and secure our energy independence, and Montana has the opportunity to lead the way. China is actively working to beat America in the clean energy sector in hope of taking over as the world’s strongest economy. We can’t afford to lose this competition. That is why we should invest directly in Montana companies researching next-generation energy technologies that are affordable and lower costs for consumers. Traditional energy sources like oil and gas remain a critical part of how we power our country, so we need to continue to invest in research and development of technologies like carbon capture and storage to reduce carbon emissions.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "What’s happening on the southern border is unacceptable. \n\nI’ve called on President Biden to step up and do everything in his power to secure the border, and I supported a strong bipartisan deal to get our border under control earlier this year. This bipartisan bill was backed by the National Border Patrol Council and would have hired more border patrol agents, cracked down on the fentanyl crisis, and tightened asylum standards. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues voted to keep the border open for another year so they could campaign on the issue.\n\nI have been talking with Montanans, sheriffs, and mayors, they all are feeling the consequences of the situation at the southern border, from stretched law enforcement budgets to fentanyl in the communities. I was proud that my bipartisan FEND Off Fentanyl Act passed to place sanctions on countries engaged in international trafficking of illegal fentanyl and give law enforcement the resources they need to battle the fentanyl crisis.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "Every Montanan deserves access to affordable and quality health care — especially for folks in rural communities where access to health services can mean the difference between life and death. That is why I have fought in the Senate to address health care worker shortages in rural Montana and secured crucial resources for our rural hospitals and clinics, including better funding for emergency services.\n\nThere are some politicians who want to fully privatize our health care system. I oppose any plan to do so. This would put our rural hospitals and critical programs like Medicare at risk. I will stand tough against any plan to privatize Medicare, because our seniors shouldn't have to forgo health care just because they can’t afford it. I was proud to pass legislation that allowed Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35/month — and I will fight to ensure that Montana’s nursing homes stay open and fully-staffed.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?",
          "answer": "As chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee my top priority is to always keep America safe, and ensure Montana stays the greatest state in the greatest country in the world. Our military priorities should lie in protecting America and our allies, and staying ahead of our adversaries like China and Russia who want to replace us as the world’s leading superpower. I’ll fight tooth and nail to defend America from military, economic, and democratic threats. \n\nWe should be strategic and only involve America in foreign conflicts when it strengthens our alliances and benefits the United States. The U.S. can’t and shouldn’t get involved in every foreign conflict, but America is safer when we have strong alliances and our allies know they can trust the U.S. to stand by them when facing threats. \n\nMy top priority will always be defending Montana and our nation, full stop. I’ll continue fighting to forcefully counter foreign adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n"

Repke, 67 as of Election Day, received both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business finance and spent 40 years working in the field.\n\nPrior to an unsuccessful bid for the Montana Public Service Commission in 2022, Repke worked as the chief financial officer for SmartLam, a wood products manufacturer based in Columbia Falls. Repke held executive-level positions at HAVI Global Logistics and Waste Management, Inc. Repke said his professional experience has familiarized him with insurance programs, self-funded employee health plans and risk management generally.\n\n“As a lifelong consumer of insurance products, I value the protections offered by the policies, but also understand the frustrations of dealing with the complexities of purchasing coverages and dealing with the claims processes,” Repke said. “This is especially true with medical insurance where I have direct experience handling the insurance matters related to my late wife’s long, difficult battle with pancreatic cancer.”\n\nRepke said he’s actively engaged in his community and in organizations focused on public land access. He added that he believes that “keeping Montana the last, best place’ for [his] grandkids’ generation” requires a commitment to the integrity of state government.\n\nThis biography is based on Repke’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and Repke’s LinkedIn page.\n",

It is a complex issue requiring the involvement of insurers, risk management organizations, and the state.

We will be informing the public on current trends in fraud and deceptive practices that are taking place not only in Montana but nationwide. We will educate the public in email phishing scams, phone scams and other means being used to take advantage of Montana consumers.\n\nWe will aggressively investigate fraud cases and prosecute bad actors to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n\n"

This will not be an easy task based on the current state of the insurance industry but it will be essential in securing coverage for Montanans across the state.\n\nThe auditor’s office will also become a resource for providing consumers information on how they can better protect their homes through proper wildfire mitigation. I believe if we can prove to insurance carriers that our citizens know how to help protect their property we can find common ground to make coverage more affordable and available to all. \n\n"

          "answer": "Yes. We need to reject any tax cuts, including renewal of the big 2017 tax cut for the wealthy, reject arms deliveries to Israel’s right wing government, and reject the proposed $150 billion Nuclear Missile Modernization package, which includes $20 billion to the U.S. Department of Energy for 1,250 new Nuclear arheads for the modernized Sentinel.\n\n"

Co-operative members with proprietary leases for a dwelling in such structures will be able to enjoy a gain in equity, limited by the increase in the community’s median income for the corresponding period. The Federal Housing and Urban Development program for guaranteeing 90 percent of required long term financing of the multifamily structures will have to be made as robust as is required.\n\n"

Converting from fossil fired electricity, combined with sequestering carbon under ground and in our built environment have to become a way of life, aided by federal incentives.\n\n"

          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "In addition to working with Rep. Gonzales, I’d visit with former smokejumpers I know who have worked as human being trackers and border patrol pilots. We have to begin with ground truths and the Constitution to fashion a comprehensive, humane  and orderly immigration and naturalization process for addressing human migration. \n\n"

Krautter is the only candidate in the GOP primary field who has said he will not vote for Donald Trump if he’s the Republican nominee in the upcoming presidential election, offering at a recent Yellowstone County party event that he will write in a candidate.\n\nAs he campaigns this year, he is touting his experience living in both rural eastern Montana and the state’s largest city.\n\n“I’m running for Congress to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington that will crush chaos and restore economic and social stability to our nation,” he said.\n\nThis biography is based on materials submitted by Krautter’s campaign and prior MTFP reporting.\n",

          "answer": "Water is the lifeblood of eastern and central Montana, where rural communities depend upon access to clean drinking water and agriculture producers depend on reliable access to water for their crops. In Congress, I will be a tireless advocate on water-related issues, for irrigation projects that agriculture depends upon and by supporting infrastructure investments in water projects that rural communities need for clean drinking water.\n\nPublic safety is critical to our communities and that is why I strongly disagreed with the $1.2 trillion Biden-Schumer 2024 budget bill that passed and defunded federal law enforcement agencies by $1 billion. That is the type of chaos in Washington, D.C. that will negatively impact Montana communities and we need to crush. Connected to public safety is the need to secure the U.S. southern border — which I personally visited in February — to fight illegal drugs and cartels.\n\n"

          "answer": "Out-of-control deficit spending is a threat to the future of our country. We can get our budget back on track by reforming our legislative processes in a manner that allows for a fiscally conservative approach to financing government programs. Targeting one specific program of the budget for cuts will not achieve overall reduction of our budget.\nFirst, we need to have single-subject legislation in Congress, rather than large thousand-page, multi-subject omnibus bills. Single-subject legislation allows bills to pass or fail on their own merits.\n\nSecond, we need to get back to regular order —  bills starting in committees, being debated and voted on and then moving to the full house for amendments, votes and compromise, rather than large legislation bypassing normal procedures.\n\nFinally, we need to get back to asking whether whatever the federal government wants to do is specifically contemplated by the Constitution as being the responsibility of the federal government or not.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Solutions to the housing issues are generally best addressed at the state and local level, not in Washington, D.C. However, Congress should investigate and evaluate any federal regulatory barriers discouraging development of additional housing or that may be distorting housing markets and access to affordable financing options for first-time home buyers.\n\n"

I do support responsible development of Montana’s natural resources that also complies with the Montana Constitution’s guaranteed right to a “clean and healthful environment.” I do think climate change is happening and that there are areas Congress can work on, such as by providing incentives in the forms of tax credits or grants, for businesses and individuals to adopt more sustainable practices, promote innovative carbon reducing or capturing practices, invest in energy efficiency and reduce waste.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "I’ve been to the chaotic U.S. southern border and have observed this national security threat to Montana and our entire nation personally. I support a bipartisan strategy that provides the resources and personnel needed to secure the border and reduce the chaos. This includes more border patrol agents, immigration officers and judges, together with reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy.\n\n"

          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "Americans deserve a health care system that provides high-quality health care that is both accessible and affordable.\n\nCongress needs to shine a spotlight on all sectors of the health care industry and look for ways to promote transparency for consumers and the public, as the best ways of raising awareness about practices that may not be in consumers interests. Areas Congress should look at in the health care industry includes the influence and power of the pharmaceutical industry on the cost of prescription drugs, as well as the many mergers and consolidations of hospitals. The interests of families, patients and communities must be put first, over shareholder profits and dividends. The health care industry is not a traditional market where there is ample choice for consumers, which means there are dangers for monopolistic and anticompetitive abuses occurring, requiring adequate oversight at the federal and state level.\n"

He and his law partner, Pat Fox, represent people with personal injury claims and insurance disputes. \n\nHunt was born in Missoula, raised in Chester and has lived in Helena since the 1980s. His wife and two daughters work in the mental health and social work fields, a fact Hunt says has influenced his understanding of society. Hunt says he is running for governor as a Democrat to pursue a more fair and equitable state.\n\n“The governor turned down $15,000,000 for hungry children, had a $2.5-billion budget surplus and still raised state property taxes on Montana homeowners,” Hunt told MTFP. \n\nHunt graduated from the University of Montana School of Law in 1982. After his father, Bill Hunt, was elected to the Montana Supreme Court, Hunt took over his father’s law practice. He previously ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, losing in the 2008 Democratic primary. \n\nThis biography is based on Hunt’s professional website and responses to MTFP.\n",

Gianforte had a $2.5 billion budget surplus, courtesy of the federal government, and still raised state property taxes on Montana homeowners by $250 million a year. And he cut taxes for big corporations and utilities. I will fight for tax fairness for Montana homeowners so they don’t shoulder burdensome and increasing property taxes while big corporations and utilities get property tax cuts. That’s not fair. Montanans are struggling to find places where they can live and work and these Republican property tax hikes are only making things worse.\n\n"

What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?",
          "answer": "Yes, I believe changes are needed. I was involved in the school funding litigation in the late 80s and early 90s. Changes were made after the courts ruled changes were necessary to make funding equitable. I support a system that ensures equally funding for all school systems. Wealthier communities should not have better resourced schools than poorer communities. When this happens, it contributes to unequal educational opportunity and economic disparity. I would eliminate tax credits for private school tuition.\n\n"

What are your priorities regarding abortion access?",
          "answer": "I am 110% for individual freedom and private medical decisions. Gianforte wants to take away Montanans’ freedoms by telling women how to manage their private health care decisions. These decisions are deeply personal and private. The government, and Gianforte, shouldn’t get between a Montanan and their private health care providers. It’s simple. Keep the government out of our private health care decisions. Period.

          "answer": "Absolutely. As governor, I would sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form. Studies are clear: Early childhood intervention is critical to protect Montana's most valuable natural resource. Good medical care is critical to successful early childhood intervention and development. For adults, good medical care means more productive workers and a healthier population. Instead of proper health care, the GOP wants Montanans to get our primary care in hospital emergency rooms. Emergency room care costs more and provides less.

Give tax incentives to first time home buyers and homebuilders for houses valued below a level determined by the geographical area. Montana needs affordable housing. We don’t have enough affordable housing stock and out-of-state buyers are moving in and pushing up home prices that are beyond the means of many working Montanans.

But he’s also been open about what he considers the political stakes of the election as Montana’s judicial branch and Republican officials increasingly find themselves at odds on their interpretation of the constitution as it pertains to issues like abortion.\n\n“Montanans of all political stripes face assaults on their constitutional rights and attempts by partisan extremists and out-of-state corporate interests to wrest control of government from the hands of the people,” Lynch told MTFP. “The Montana Constitution is a living document that derives its power from the consent of the governed. If we ignore it, or demean it, or allow it to be chipped away by whatever political party is currently in the majority, we will have only ourselves to blame when our government ceases to function.”\n\nLynch also told MTFP his legal philsophy is simply to issue rulings based on the facts of the case and existing law and precedent. \n\n“In my opinion, a good justice is someone who can write an opinion that may upset his friends and earn the respect of his opponents because that is what the facts and the law require,” he said.\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Lynch as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n",

So long as the courts are perceived to be independent and nonpartisan, their rulings will be perceived as legitimate, and their orders will be respected. But if courts begin to issue rulings based not on the law and the facts but along political lines, the public’s trust in them will fade and their future rulings will not be perceived as legitimate. I believe the very act of issuing nonpartisan, impartial decisions will ensure that the courts continue to function as the founders intended. And function they must, because the courts are our society’s last line of defense against authoritarianism, oligarchy, and many other political ills.\n"

Fielder defended that vote in a later proceeding that upheld the rate increase.\n\n​​“I wish that prices across the board were not up so high in this country the way they are, but I believe the commission did its best that it could with the parameters that have been given to use under the law,” Fielder said. \n\nFielder didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire.

          "question": "Regulatory matters under the PSC’s jurisdiction are often highly specialized and complex. Please describe your qualifications for performing the technical aspects of the commission's work.",
          "answer": "Montana’s long-term energy security depends on maintaining a business-friendly climate for energy investment. As a commissioner, I will work with colleagues in the Legislature and the development community to remove barriers that restrict investment and drive up utility bills.\nIncreasingly, Montana’s energy policy is dictated by forces outside our borders. We need Montana-based resources, capable of delivering in all weather conditions.\nWhether it’s at regional energy forums, public hearings before the Environmental Protection Agency, or the Department of Energy, our commissioners need to play a more active role in discussions and decisions impacting customers and generation facilities in the state. I welcome the opportunity to help lead that effort."

          "question": "To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?",
          "answer": "I believe the free market should dictate that, and renewables need to stand on their own, in relationship to affordability to the consumer, and not propped up with higher rates or subsidies that the consumer ultimately pays for, either with increased rates, or tax dollars respectively, used to offset the additional cost of any mandate created by climate change policy.\n\n"

        {
          "question": "Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?",
          "answer": "Despite the promise of wind and solar, the intermittent nature of those resources combined with the lack of energy density, and huge amounts of land required mean that wind and solar simply can’t form the bedrock of our energy system. I am, however, intrigued by the research being done in battery storage capacity. As storage capacity becomes greater in respect to time, this will help renewables that have intermittent generation capabilities become a more viable, and therefore affordable option.\n\nI also see nuclear having some potential down the road, but in my mind, hydrogen shows the most promise as an additional, carbon-free resource that could be produced here in Montana, and has ability to be stored in the ground, to be used on demand at a later time.\n\nRounding out renewables, hydro power is still the original clean, green energy. We have infrastructure already in place, so investments in maintaining and improving hydro will remain an affordable option for Montana.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?",
          "answer": "I believe that benefit/cost analysis should be used, but only when coupled with socioeconomic analysis as well. At the time our statutes that regulate the PSC were enacted, it was a foregone conclusion that hydro and fossil fuel would power this state. However, in this day and age with the renewables, and with the development of these, we must keep our eye on the ball, to keep our highly trained workforce on the job. Keeping people working should be the highest priority, in these analyses.\n\nIn addition to artificial intelligence used in calculating cost/ benefit, it's actually people, from management, to skilled labor, and its infrastructure from mines and dams to the generation facilities, all in tandem that bolster its ability to produce reliable power, and sell it for reasonable rates.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?",
          "answer": "Educate the public on the role of the PSC, and like any public process, encourage folks to take an active role in the process itself by communicating with their respective PSC commissioners, and more importantly the ratepayer’s advocate agency, the Montana Consumer Counsel, by having a hand in setting the policy that affects all Montanans.\n\nCommissioners need to be good listeners and keep an open mind in order to strike a fair balance between reliable and affordable service rates.\n\nSimply put, its putting people ahead of politics, while also keeping the providers in a position of viability, so they continue to provide vital services to all Montana ratepayers.\n"

Earlier this year, Ellsworth announced the formation of a special legislative committee to probe what he and other Republicans have labeled overreach by the judiciary following a series of adverse rulings.\n\n“Ellsworth believes there’s much to be done within the Montana Supreme Court,” his campaign website reads. “By restoring coequal power among the branches of government, improving oversight, and addressing constitutional cases, he aims to strengthen the judiciary.”\n\nEllsworth is entering the second half of his four-year Senate term, so even if he loses the GOP Supreme Court clerk primary, he’ll remain in the Senate. \n\nEllsworth has his own personal history with the legal system: In 2021, [he pled guilty](https://montanafreepress.org/2021/08/02/jason-ellsworth-pleads-guilty-obstructing-officer/) to obstructing a peace officer during a traffic stop in a case prosecuted by current state Supreme Court candidate Cory Swanson, the Broadwater County attorney. And in 2009, he was ordered to pay a six-figure fine as part of a Federal Trade Commission judgment [related to his telemarketing company](https://ravallirepublic.com/news/local/ellsworth-gop-candidate-in-senate-dist-43-primary-explains-ftc-case-that-cost-him-600/article_5fa4543f-b659-5a97-9b82-25bdcb06c3f4.html). \n\nEllsworth didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire.

Gianforte was later elected as Montana’s at-large U.S. representative in 2017 and reelected in 2018.\n\nA former technology entrepreneur who built Bozeman-based RightNow Technologies [into a $1.5 billion business](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-rightnow-102411.html) before selling it to Oracle in 2011, Gianforte has cut income taxes, capital gains taxes and reduced tax burdens for business equipment during his first term. He has signed into law government restrictions on abortion, religious freedom protections and school choice policies, and also established task forces intended to address housing affordability issues and property taxes.\n\nIn his campaign for a second term, Gianforte is pledging to grow Montana’s economy and rein in government regulations.\n\n“For too long, Montana hasn’t lived up to our full, outstanding potential, and while we’ve made great progress to reach our potential over the last three years, there’s still more to do to create more good-paying Montana jobs, boost opportunities for all Montanans and protect our Montana way of life,” Gianforte told MTFP.\n\nGianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in 2017 after he physically attacked a journalist in the closing days of his 2017 congressional campaign. He [was also formally warned by state game wardens](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/govt-and-politics/gianforte-says-he-made-mistake-trapping-wolf-without-certification-class/article_220c5e44-4f02-516f-a8db-210a1fcbb0c4.html) after trapping a wolf in 2021 without completing a required certification course and fined $70 in 2000 after self-reporting that he had shot a spike bull elk in a district where hunting was restricted to brow-tined bulls, according to Lee Newspapers.  \n\nThis biography is based on MTFP’s reporting on Gianforte’s first term, media reports, and other existing public records.\n",

          "question": "Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services but are calculated through a system set at the state level. What if any changes to the state tax system would you support?",
          "answer": "As I’ve said and as Montanans know all too well, property taxes are too high and need to be reined in. Last year, we delivered Montana homeowners property tax rebates of up to $1,350 and permanent reforms, saving them over $120 million. Taken together, these measures completely offset the property tax increase of the average Montana homeowner. \n\nI’m committed to delivering long-term solutions to rising property taxes. With about 85% of property taxes being collected and spent at the local level, I support reining in out-of-control county spending. We tried to do just that in the 2023 legislative session with SB 511, but special interest lobbyists killed the bill. Just like hardworking Montanans, government at all levels, including local government, should live within its means.\n\nI also support providing Montana homeowners with a homestead exemption, ensuring out-of-staters, who own second homes in Montana, pay their fair share for our law enforcement, schools, and roads and bridges.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?",
          "answer": "My priority is to support teachers, empower parents, and deliver the best education possible for our kids so they can reach their full potential.\n\nLast year, we provided record funding for our K-12 public education system. I also stood with our public schools and students when some counties refused to collect the full 95 public school mills. The state collects those mills and fully returns them to school districts to ensure each Montana student has access to a quality education, as the law and our Constitution require. The mills better ensure that students have access to a quality education, regardless of whether they live in lower-resourced school districts or better-resourced ones, like Big Sky. My opponent has criticized collecting the 95 mills, which would have cut public school funding.\n\nI am also proud to have proposed the TEACH Act, and signed it into law in 2021. The TEACH Act provides millions of dollars in incentives to local school districts to raise starting teacher pay.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Montana maintains largely unencumbered legal access to abortion as a result of the state Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Montana Constitution’s right of privacy, even as other states restrict when and how patients can terminate their pregnancies. What are your priorities regarding abortion access?",
          "answer": "All life is precious and must be protected. We’ve made progress to protect life —  protecting a child born alive as a result of botched abortion, requiring a doctor to provide a woman with the option to see an ultrasound, safeguarding parental consultation when a 16-year-old girl seeks an abortion, and eliminating taxpayer-funded abortion. Voters know where I stand, but my opponent refuses to say where he stands, including whether he thinks on-demand abortion should be available all the way up to the ninth month.\n\nThe reality is Montana is unique. The Montana Supreme Court in 1999 interpreted our Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion.\n\nAbortion is a heart-wrenching decision facing pregnant mothers. As we work to protect as many unborn lives as possible, we must also have compassion for these women. We must love them both —  mother and unborn child. We must also expand upon our successful work to encourage adoption, so that more children can find loving, healthy homes.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Montana is one of the states that expanded Medicaid access under the federal Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to previously uninsured populations. As governor, would you sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form in 2025?",
          "answer": "The safety net of Medicaid should be there for those who truly need it, but it will collapse if all are allowed to climb on it.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the federal government didn’t allow states to verify eligibility for Medicaid, and Medicaid enrollment spiked. Last year, the federal government required states to begin verifying eligibility again. Since then, we’ve ensured only those who are eligible can participate, and enrollment is back down to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nMedicaid should be a temporary program for most people to help them get back on their feet. We should encourage work and reduce government dependency by requiring able-bodied adults with no dependents, excluding seniors and single parents, to work to receive benefits.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?",
          "answer": "Joe Biden’s inflation is making it harder for Montanans to make ends meet. Our housing problem has existed, but was ignored, since 2010, as our population grew faster than housing supply.\n\nIn the last few years, we’ve made progress to solve this crisis. Because government can’t spend its way out of the housing crisis, we’ve emphasized reforms to increase housing supply while protecting our way of life from sprawl.\n\nWorking with legislators and the bipartisan Housing Task Force I launched, we made Montana a national leader, delivering historic pro-housing reforms that will boost supply and make housing more affordable and attainable. Our reforms make it faster, easier and cheaper to build homes. We created incentives for communities to build more densely. We’ve allowed ADUs, apartments in commercial areas and increased access to starter homes.\n\nThe results won’t come overnight, but I’m proud of what we’ve done and remain focused on continuing to build on our pro-housing reforms.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?",
          "answer": "My faith is a guiding light and deeply personal. Just as faith guides many Montanans, my faith has positively influenced my life.\n\nGovernment alone can’t provide the full services and support to the people it serves. A central part of our Montana way of life is neighbors help neighbors. Our nonprofit organizations and places of worship also support and serve others. For example, about one in four individuals who seek help for mental health turn to faith leaders before they seek clinical professionals.\n\nIn 2022, our Department of Public Health and Human Services launched the Office of Faith and Community Based Services to strengthen partnerships with organizations that play a fundamental role in supporting health and wellness, as well as self-reliant individuals. By working with these organizations we’re expanding resources and strategies to improve health outcomes for all Montanans.\n\nWe’ll continue to emphasize partnerships between the state and organizations that support Montanans.\n"

          "question": "What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?",
          "answer": "Federal government overreach, overspending and irresponsibility are destroying the country. The Biden administration has failed to secure our border and is allowing illegal migrants to overrun our nation and threaten our national security. The number of illegal aliens that entered our country under Biden is six times Montana’s population.\n\nOur national debt is crushing our families and children by exacerbating inflation and making everyday goods inaccessible. The bureaucracy is attacking our way of life with burdensome regulations. As a member of the Land Board, I fiercely protected Montanans personal property and water rights. I promise to reign in the overreaching regulations of the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nThe federal government is out of control and is damaging the American dream for Montanans. We must put America first. That means protecting our borders, supporting Montanan farmers, ranchers, and small business owners, and not saddling our future generations with crushing debt.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?",
          "answer": "I admire Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, who took out RINO Liz Cheney. Congresswoman Hageman isn’t afraid to tackle tough issues and champions issues that are important to Montanans. She wants to return education back to the states by dismantling the Department of Education. The congresswoman supports property and water rights and is fighting to make America energy independent.\n\nI also admire Congressman Matt Rosendale and many of the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) members who have led the way to get federal spending under control. I am honored to have the endorsement of the HFC chairman, Congressman Bob Good, and other members such as Congressmen Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Mary Miller, Troy Nehls and Josh Brecheen. I also have the endorsements of Montana Freedom Caucus members Sen. John Fuller, Sen. Steve Hinebauch, Sen. Dan Bartel, Rep. Jerry Schillinger and Rep. Bob Phalen. These members endorsed me because I will fight for conservative values, cut spending, and put America first. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?",
          "answer": "I would happily work with anyone who wants to put America first, secure our border and prioritize prosperity for our citizens. I also would welcome an invitation to the White House to enlighten Biden on how his reckless policies have hurt Montanans and all Americans. Hopefully, the administration would change its position on the border, the economy, energy and many other policy areas. \n\nBiden’s most recent sweeping changes to the Department of Education Title IX rules creates a one-size-fits-all policy that removes any local input into our schools with a radically woke redefinition of sex. This rule threatens women-only spaces and women’s sports. That is why I submitted a public comment opposing this rule when it was first proposed. As superintendent of public instruction, I directed schools to not implement these changes, and I will continue to fight against this destructive change to Title IX with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen.\n\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?",
          "answer": "I would work with President Trump to secure our border, return energy independence, unleash economic potential of small businesses and put America First. President Trump is America’s best chance to get back on track to protect the American dream. That is why I was the first in this congressional race to endorse him.\n\nTogether, President Trump and I will work to drain the swamp of the entrenched bureaucrats who unfairly target Montana families, ranchers and farmers. The southern border will be secured to stop the flow of dangerous cartels who poison our communities with fentanyl. Since 2017 there has been an increase of 1,900% in fentanyl deaths in Montana. America will once again be energy independent when Montana leads the way in accessing the abundance of natural resources our country possesses. President Trump and I will unleash the economic potential of Americans, and our global enemies will respect and fear us. Once again, we will have leadership that puts America first.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?",
          "answer": "America’s debt problem is the biggest threat facing our nation. The government has a spending problem, not a taxing problem. Our debt is currently over $34 trillion dollars, that is more than $103,000 for every citizen. U.S. interest payments will hit $870 billion this year — that is more than America spends on defense. Congress cannot tax their way out of this problem. I will never vote to increase taxes on the hardworking families of Montana.\n\nCongress must focus on cutting the wasteful spending of the bureaucracy. I have a record of cutting spending at the Office of Public Instruction, and Montana voters know that I will bring that fiscal responsibility to the D.C. swamp. Congress can cut the Department of Education, the IRS, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the EPA, which has been weaponized against Montana farmers and ranchers. There are many opportunities to cut spending across all the agencies, and I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for Montanans.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?",
          "answer": "I believe that every life is precious. I will always protect the lives of those who cannot advocate for themselves, the unborn. The Dobbs v. Jackson decision from the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade and returned abortion policy back to the states. This decision established that states have the authority to enact restrictions on abortions. Federally, Congress can ensure that tax dollars are not used for abortions by prohibiting funding from going to national and international organizations whose main purpose is promoting and performing abortions. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?",
          "answer": "Much of the housing crisis here is due to misguided policies from the federal government and state regulations. Inflation, mainly caused by out-of-control federal spending and rising energy costs, make it harder to build and maintain housing.\nCongress must cut regulations that hurt Montana small businesses, our farmers and ranchers, and our ability to build affordable homes. The bureaucracy in D.C knows nothing of the struggles our communities face, instead they restrict the innovation that made America great.\n\nHigh energy costs burden our businesses and farmers which in turn increases the cost of all necessary goods for Americans. One of the first legislative initiates I would pursue is unleashing American energy potential. Here in Montana, we can lead the way. Congress needs to expand an “all of the above” energy production policy that allows natural gas and oil producers to access and provide these abundant resources to Americans.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?",
          "answer": "Far too often the government bureaucracy gives into climate alarmists who present a false choice between a strong economy and a clean environment. In reality, America’s free market has allowed innovation that has made us a leader among nations. Shutting down energy production, like climate activists want, will only hurt American industry and ingenuity. Free market consumer choices should lead rather than the heavy hand of the government. Between the cold weather and long distances in Montana, electric vehicle mandates are not feasible or realistic. Mandating electric vehicles, as the Biden administration has done, will cripple our farmers and fundamentally hurt our ability to grow and transport food.\n\nRogue nations like China are the true polluters of this world. Yet America buys critical minerals from China instead of accessing the abundance of U.S. resources. America will create jobs through the responsible development of resources, spur innovation, and not use child labor. \n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?",
          "answer": "Quite frankly, improving our national security along the border and reforming our immigration system is the top priority for Montana and America. Since Joe Biden took office there have been over 7.2 million illegals who invaded the U.S. through our southern border. That number is greater than the population of 36 states. First and foremost, Congress must secure the border by finishing the wall and implementing technologies that will assist our Border Patrol agents. Congress must reauthorize the Remain in Mexico policy put in place by President Trump and end “catch and release.” The backlog in the immigration courts must be addressed so that a free pass isn’t given to criminals, terrorists and drug dealers. Finally, America must deport illegal migrants who have flagrantly broken U.S. law, by dealing drugs, stealing property and assaulting and murdering U.S. citizens.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?",
          "answer": "The government needs to reign in the regulations and strengthen the freedom to choose what health insurance they want. Congress must enact legislation that treats employees the same way as employers. Workers should be able to purchase their own plan with pre-tax dollars and take it with them from job to job. This would be especially beneficial for those later in life when health problems often materialize.\n\nObamacare’s top-down, one-size-fits-all strategy increased costs, decreased quality and consolidated the health care market, reducing competition and choice for patients. Montanans must be empowered to take control of their health care decisions and allowed to purchase the insurance they want, not the insurance the government dictates to them. Congress must promote transparency in health care price and quality, so families are not surprised by bills. I will work to improve health care access for our rural and aging communities in Montana who are often ignored by D.C. special interests.\n"

    "summaryNarrative": "Evans is a political newcomer who was cleared to appear on the general election ballot as an independent after she collected more than 5,000 signatures from voters in the district. \n\nA geologist by training who works as Missoula County’s environmental health manager, Evans told MTFP in June that she was inspired to run for the Public Service Commission after it voted last year to increase rates for NorthWestern Energy’s residential electricity customers. She argues that members of the PSC are failing to treat the commission work as a  full-time job.\n\n“It’s disappointing that folks who get a really decent salary to fulfill this job aren’t necessarily participating to the fullest extent,” said Evans, who earned a master’s degree in geology from the University of Montana.\n\nIn addition to criticizing the commission’s vote on the rate hike, Evans has accused the sitting commissioners of opposing “commonsense, cost-saving measures” and harboring an “anti-technology sentiment.” Evans argues that the current commission’s approach hinders economic development in Montana by driving up energy bills for residential customers and companies, which often in turn pass on those increases to consumers.\n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP interview with Evans and information from her campaign website.\n",

I’ve also completed Incident Command System and household hazardous waste operator training and received my Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response certification. My coursework, certifications and experience demonstrate my ability to understand complex systems, interpret rules and regulations, and understand how small details will impact real people. \n\nWhile at the Montana Association of Conservation Districts, I managed budgets, organizational documents, legal compliance, lobbying, and staff supervision. In each of these areas, I solved complex problems and worked hard to make government regulations understandable and manageable for conservation districts across the state.\n"

Instead of asking hard questions in planning documents, the current PSC rubber stamps decisions that have big impacts on consumers and businesses. Why was Colstrip down during the cold snap? What are we doing to adequately prepare for wildfire? What factors go into Public Safety Power shutoffs? How are we preparing our hydropower resources for drought?  What improvements will result from the big storm that left people in Missoula and Mineral Counties without power for days? The first step in planning for the future is holding utilities accountable to their current plans.\n\nIt’s important to be sure to make decisions with the appropriate data and in the decision-making space provided by statute and the constitution. It’s also important to use the authority of the PSC to its fullest extent in order to achieve the mission.\n"

          "answer": "Above all, the PSC needs to listen to Montanans and make decisions in a transparent manner as they tackle these challenges. Utilities need to plan for the future and discuss their expenses in planning documents openly and honestly. As changes become more complex, it will be even more important for planning to be transparent and for the PSC to make utilities respond to feedback from customers and business owners who provide comments on the long range plan.\n\nThere are opportunities (new transmission lines, reconductoring, etc.) that the PSC needs to push utilities to consider. The PSC should be looking at these opportunities and bigger markets to identify how companies can grow in a way that drives down cost for consumers and takes advantage of our skilled workforce. The recent storm in Missoula and Mineral counties shows how fragile our energy grid is. It’s an opportune time to think about tools and technology, like batteries and mini-grids, that could be implemented over time to provide more stability.\n"

Montana Electric Co-ops are pursuing an array of creative solutions and it should be evaluated if these ideas can be scaled to the larger grid. Our workforce and business community is primed to take advantage of markets and opportunities, but we need to ensure that we do so in a fair, forward-looking way.\n\nRecently, Northwestern Energy submitted documents for a rate case that was missing essential information. Why would a huge company think it was appropriate to submit an application that doesn’t meet the standards? Because the PSC has allowed them to do it before. Let’s get people on the PSC who want to do the job and represent the people.\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?",
          "answer": "Three years ago, a routine legislative audit revealed that Public Service Commissioners were spending tax dollars on flight upgrades and expensive computer gear. The audit proved that some commissioners even falsified documents so they wouldn’t get caught wasting our money. A Republican State Senator called the behavior “despicable.” This year, a new audit revealed more problems, including high staff turnover, and suggested that commissioners needed a code of conduct to ensure good behavior.\n\nIn short, the current PSC is a mess, and taxpayers deserve better. As a lifelong public servant, I’ve always stressed professional conduct, honesty, and transparency. If elected, I will hold other commissioners to the same standard. I would work to implement the recommendations of auditors and respect the concerns of staff members.\n\nThe PSC mission is to ensure an affordable, reliable, and sustainable power supply to utility customers, and there is no room for unprofessional conduct as we pursue that goal.\n"

    "summaryNarrative": "Rehberg, 68, is a Billings businessman and onetime Montana political fixture who is making a bid to return to office this year after spending more than a decade largely out of the state’s political spotlight.\n\nRehberg previously represented Montana in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2013, leaving office after making a failed bid for U.S. Senate against Democrat Jon Tester in 2012. He also served as lieutenant governor under Republicans Stan Stephens and Marc Racicot. Over the course of his business career, he has worked as a cashmere goat rancher, operated fast food restaurant franchises and developed real estate. He has also served as co-chairman of Washington, D.C. public affairs firm Mercury.\n\nIn interviews and public statements, Rehberg has touted his experience in Congress and cast himself as a known quantity for eastern district voters.\n\n“I know how to make my way around. And really what you do in Congress is you build coalitions of like-minded people,” he told Montana Talks host Aaron Flint in February 2024.\n\nRehberg and two of his staffers were injured in [a high-profile Flathead Lake boat crash](https://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927) in 2009. The boat’s driver, a state senator, later pleaded no contest to a felony criminal endangerment charge.\n\nRehberg declined to participate in MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on [prior MTFP reporting](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/02/21/denny-rehberg-vying-return-to-congress/) and a profile published this year [by the Billings Gazette](https://billingsgazette.com/news/state-regional/denny-rehberg-congress-house-rosendale/article_085aff14-d0dc-11ee-9d1c-2bdc88383dcd.html).\n",

It undermines the reliability of the law, and I felt I could do better.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Swanson as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n",

          "question": "Briefly describe the legal philosophy you would bring to the bench. As you see it, what is the difference between a good Supreme Court justice and a bad one?",
          "answer": "Justices must strive to uphold the rule of law by providing the very best legal interpretation possible to resolve the legal question in each case before us, and also to build a body of case law that others may rely upon. To do so, I would interpret every legal document as a textualist, according to the philosophy of judicial restraint. That means resolve the case before you, not the next five cases you can imagine. That means following precedent unless there is a compelling reason to depart from it, not modifying precedent as it suits you to reach preferred outcomes.\n\nA good Supreme Court justice should work hard and learn every day. He or she should follow the law to the case's conclusion. He or she should respect the power of the office by not abusing it or disrespecting the litigants. Finally, a good justice should build a professional atmosphere of honest debate and collective learning, not anger or score-settling. A bad justice lets personality get in the way of duty.\n\n"

          "question": "What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?",
          "answer": "There are two open seats on the Montana Supreme Court this year, which means the court will change significantly, no matter who wins. The chief justice race features two philosophical contrasts.\n\nIf I win, I will try to make the court less about the personality of each Justice, and more about cultivating the wisdom and experience of each member to produce our best legal interpretation. It is not the court's job to actively fight for or against any party or case. It is the court's job to render unbiased and accurate legal opinions that deliver justice to the people. Focus on the law, not the politics.\n\nThe chief justice also advocates for the budget and resources for the entire judicial branch. With my background and commitment to judicial process, I will effectively defend the judiciary in the budget and policy arenas, not perpetuate ill-conceived inter-branch feuds. People are counting on timely and accurate court outcomes, and I will fight for the resources to deliver them.\n\n"
        },
        {
          "question": "How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?",
          "answer": "To modify a phrase from Chief Justice John Roberts, the quickest way to remove politics from case decisions is to stop deciding cases on the basis of politics.\n\nThe Supreme Court should focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging, no matter the case before it. But some cases are inherently political, so what to do? Just focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging. Follow the rules of interpretation like you would for any case. Let the law lead to the outcome, don't decide the outcome and then modify the law or overturn precedent to get there. That is fundamental to the problem and the solution.\n\nIf the judiciary simply does its job in this manner, then political cases will be just like every other case: the loser will be upset, but the reasoning will be clear and unassailable. The Supreme Court should uphold the rule of law by removing political concerns from its legal interpretations. Let the law be clear, and let the political chips fall where they may.\n"

    "summaryNarrative": "Molnar, 74 as of Election Day, is a longtime state lawmaker from Laurel who previously served on the PSC from 2005 to 2012.\n\nMolnar said he plans to give up his Montana Senate seat — he is in the midst of his second term — “because this is my passion and where I can do the most good.” He currently sits on the Senate Energy and Taxation committees.\n\nMolnar said he’s willing to have an “open mind” about the matters that come before the PSC and prioritizes the needs and concerns of his constituents over lobbyists working for the companies the commission regulates. During his tenure at the Capitol, he’s developed a reputation as [a lawmaker willing to vote against his party](https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/lawmakers/Brad-Molnar/#floor-statistics).\n\n“I’m going to win the fights I can win in the battle that is the biggest battle in Montana that nobody recognizes,” Molnar said. “I do, and I’m going to fight it.”\n\nMolnar said he has remained engaged with the commission’s work and would like to see the PSC work with NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest regulated power monopoly, on long-range planning.\n\nWhile serving on the PSC, Molnar was fined $200 in 2011 for leaving the scene of a collision where he backed his pickup into a high schooler’s car in the parking lot of a Laurel Burger King. [According to Lee Newspapers](https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/psc-commissioner-molnar-pleads-no-contest-to-hit-and-run/article_03b36c7c-8878-11e0-99f4-001cc4c03286.html), he told law enforcement he didn’t realize he needed to exchange information because he didn’t believe the high schooler’s car was worth more than $500. \n\nThis biography is based on an MTFP’s interview with Molnar, past media coverage and Molnar’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire.\n",

Soon, the IOU's (investor-owned utilities) must admit that a subsidy is better than a lengthy and expensive lawsuit that may not be won. Some public utility commissions are begging IOU's to not shutter for there is no replacement power during emergencies like we just experienced. I tried to head that off by writing a bill denying NorthWestern Energy stranded cost if they shut down Colstrip Unit 4 early. They killed it. If it gets critical, we should look at joining an Regional Transmission Authority (an acceptable model does not yet exist) or reconsidering the IOU model. I have already begun this process.\n\n"

The Montana Supreme Court has upheld many ill-considered district court rulings that raised the cost to consumers. Yet the PSC gets the blame. The PSC needs to educate the consumers about these ill-advised actions and not just shrug. There are many goofy things in various dockets from the past that should be re-visited and eliminated.\n\n"

He says he believes in reducing federal spending, reinstating the Trump-era “remain in Mexico” policy and opposing government efforts at combating climate change. \n\nHe’s positioned himself as a grassroots alternative to Sheehy and has accused national Republicans of attempting to manufacture the outcome of the primary following Congressman Matt Rosendale’s termination of his campaign. \n\nAs former secretary of state and chairman of the Public Service Commission, I have proven electability and a real record for Montanans to judge,” Johnson wrote in [a recent opinion column](https://missoulian.com/opinion/column/brad-johnson-election-interference-is-on-full-display-in-montana/article_a428de2e-d7fe-11ee-a5bf-2bc5ea1b1a77.html). “Mr. Sheehy has neither. Mitch McConnell and Steve Daines need to get their thumbs off the scale and let Montana Republicans choose their Senate candidate without further outside interference from The Swamp.”\n\nThis biography is based on material Johnson provided to MTFP as well as prior MTFP coverage of his campaign.\n",

However, if we were to do away with all of the discretionary spending in the budget today, it would not be enough to bring it into balance. I will strive to be a catalyst for meaningful discussions regarding the reform of entitlement programs so that we can preserve  them for future generations in a fiscally responsible manner.

Transparency and sunshine are fundamental goods in every branch of government.”\n\nHe’s also a Republican official who has previously served as executive director of the state GOP. He says that experience makes him an asset to the conservative cause — the clerk, unlike the justiceships on the Supreme Court itself, is a partisan position, and Greenwood says that’s a good thing. When Republican state officials or their attorneys come before the Supreme Court, Greenwood is “right at their side” helping them prepare, he said.\n\n“The clerk of the Montana Supreme Court is a partisan office, and thank God. In a Montana Supreme Court where extremist, progressive ideologues rule the day, Republicans must preserve every advantage we can get,” he told MTFP. “I am the only Republican anywhere near that court. We cannot risk losing the gains we've made.”\n\nThis biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Greenwood as well as prior MTFP reporting.\n",

My job is to represent the people of the state of Montana, not any national interests, and that is what I intend to do. \n\nThe instances when the Montana attorney general should participate in a national lawsuit are limited. The tobacco litigation and opioid cases are good examples — the attorney general had to participate in those cases to recover funds. If a similar case arises, then I will participate.\n\nHowever, the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources will be focused on our state. We have a drug crisis, human trafficking is on the rise, and bad actors are engaging in unfair trade practices inside Montana that target senior citizens and consumers. Those issues need to be addressed first. \n\n"

He has since been most visible as the face of Republican state government in court, mounting defenses to constitutional challenges against dozens of Republican-backed laws and joining national lawsuits against Biden Administration policies — more than 40, by his count. \n\n“I'm running for reelection so that I can continue to fight drugs and crime in our communities, fight the disastrous Biden agenda that has harmed Montanans, and fight for Montanans’ freedoms and liberties,” he said. \n\nKnudsen currently faces a [complaint from Montana’s attorney ethics organization](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/09/05/montana-ag-austin-knudsen-accused-of-violating-rules-of-professional-conduct/) due to his office's defiance of a court order during a 2021 separation of powers fight.

          "question": "The attorney general is Montana’s chief law enforcement officer. What do you see as the state’s top law enforcement issue?",
          "answer": "My top priority is the safety of our communities. We've strengthened our laws and directed more resources to those fighting on the front line. 100% of the illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine coming to Montana is manufactured by Mexican cartels and coming across the southern border. This is why I've taken aggressive and proactive legal action against the Biden policies that have left our border unprotected. Locally, we’ve dedicated more resources than ever before to local and state law enforcement, including more narcotics agents, increased participation and leadership in drug task forces, and securing 24 drug detecting K9s for agencies across the state. It's working — more than a half-million dosage units of fentanyl were taken off our streets just last year. I will continue to support law enforcement in the fight to disrupt trafficking networks, keep illegal drugs out of our communities, and aggressively target cartel affiliates and drug dealers who bring this poison into Montana\n\n\n"

          "question": "Montana attorneys general have historically worked with attorneys general from other states to advance multi-state litigation against parties such as federal officials, pharmaceutical companies and social media companies. What if any national issues would you focus the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources on?",
          "answer": "I’ve joined with my colleagues from around the country in filing more than 40 lawsuits against the federal government relating to the border, gun rights, energy development, economic policies and more. The Biden administration has abdicated its duty to secure the border, allowing drugs to pour into our country, making the fight against crime in Montana more difficult. A state like Montana can’t afford to have an attorney general who will let the federal government run roughshod over our rights.\n\nI’ve worked with other state AGs — and our own — to hold opioid manufacturers and companies in the prescription opioid distribution network accountable for their roles in the opioid epidemic, securing tens of millions of dollars for state and local governments to use for evidence-based prevention, treatment and recovery initiatives. \n\nI’ll continue to aggressively defend Montanans’ rights and our state’s interests during my second term as attorney general.\n\n"

          "question": "The attorney general has the job of defending against lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of laws passed by the state Legislature, which leaders from both major parties say will likely remain in Republican control following this year’s election cycle. How do you see yourself working with legislators as elements of the agenda they pass face judicial review?",
          "answer": "Defending state laws has become an increasingly large part of the litigation work the Department of Justice undertakes as special interest groups seek to overturn the laws duly passed by the state Legislature. The attorney general’s job is to enforce and defend the laws of our state —  period. If someone won’t commit to doing the job, they shouldn’t be running for the position.\n"
