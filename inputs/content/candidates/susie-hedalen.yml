summaryNarrative: |
  Hedalen, 40 as of Election Day, has worked at numerous levels of Montana’s K-12 school system over the past few decades, from teaching in classrooms to serving as vice-chair of the state’s Board of Public Education. She obtained a bachelor’s and a master’s degree from Montana State University, both in the education field, and is currently the superintendent of the Townsend public schools, where she lives with her husband.

  A graduate of Helena High School, Hedalen characterizes herself as a “product of Montana’s public school system” and describes a long list of professional certifications and credentials. She previously served as deputy to the current state superintendent, Republican Elsie Arntzen, and her campaign has so far focused on various state-level issues including parental rights, tribal collaboration and the enhancement of career and technical education.

  “I am running for state superintendent to get education back to basics, put parents and students first, and keep our schools safe,” Hedalen said.

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Hedalen’s campaign via a written questionnaire as well as prior MTFP reporting.
