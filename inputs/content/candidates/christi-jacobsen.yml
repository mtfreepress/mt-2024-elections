summaryNarrative: |
  Christi Jacobsen, 49 as of Election Day, was born and raised in Helena, where she and her husband have raised five children. She graduated from Carroll College and received a master’s degree in public administration from the University of Montana.

  Prior to starting her first term as secretary of state in January 2021, Jacobsen served as deputy secretary to her Republican predecessor, Corey Stapleton. A self-described “fourth generation Montanan,” she says she spends her free time hiking, fly fishing and running marathons.

  “As the current secretary of state, and true Montanan, I love my state and the people in it who I wish to serve,” Jacobsen said of her motivations for seeking reelection.

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Jacobsen’s campaign via a written questionnaire.
