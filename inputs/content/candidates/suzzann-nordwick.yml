  Nordwick, 61 as of Election Day, describes herself as the “only Trump Republican” running for the District 3 seat.

  Nordwick, a longtime Walkerville resident, is a metallurgical engineer who has made several unsuccessful bids for the Montana Legislature in the past decade. She is president of the Montana Federation of Republican Women and serves on the Butte Natural Resources Damage Restoration Council.

  Nordwick said her engineering and project management work for companies like DuPont, Sunshine Mining and Refining Company, and the Center for Advanced Material Processing has readied her for technical aspects of the commission’s work, such as calculating the operational costs of complex systems.

  Nordwick argues the commission should protect good-paying jobs and take a “Montana first” approach to energy policy that prioritizes traditional energy sources. She calls for greater transparency in the PSC’s rate-setting process and said that commissioners should prioritize the needs of their constituents, not special interests.

  “I think Montanans should elect candidates who are well-rounded professional experts and not career politicians,” Nordwick told MTFP. “I have the knowledge to keep our trains on the tracks, our lights on and our Montana homes heated throughout the winter.”

  This biography is based on Nordwick’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire, Nordwick’s campaign website and information on prior elections from Ballotpedia.
