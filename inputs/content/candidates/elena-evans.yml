summaryNarrative: |
  Evans is a political newcomer who was cleared to appear on the general election ballot as an independent after she collected more than 5,000 signatures from voters in the district. 

  A geologist by training who works as Missoula County’s environmental health manager, Evans told MTFP in June that she was inspired to run for the Public Service Commission after it voted last year to increase rates for NorthWestern Energy’s residential electricity customers. She argues that members of the PSC are failing to treat the commission work as a  full-time job.

  “It’s disappointing that folks who get a really decent salary to fulfill this job aren’t necessarily participating to the fullest extent,” said Evans, who earned a master’s degree in geology from the University of Montana.

  In addition to criticizing the commission’s vote on the rate hike, Evans has accused the sitting commissioners of opposing “commonsense, cost-saving measures” and harboring an “anti-technology sentiment.” Evans argues that the current commission’s approach hinders economic development in Montana by driving up energy bills for residential customers and companies, which often in turn pass on those increases to consumers.

  This biography is based on an MTFP interview with Evans and information from her campaign website.
