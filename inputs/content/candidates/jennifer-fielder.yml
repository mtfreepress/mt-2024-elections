summaryNarrative: |
  Fielder is a former Montana senator who is running against an independent candidate as she seeks election to a second four-year term on the PSC.

  Fielder said she has helped the “once beleaguered” PSC “become a model of good governance” during her tenure at the agency.

  Fielder argues on her campaign website that her oversight of complex regulatory matters before the PSC has saved Montana utility customers millions of dollars. 

  Fielder says she spearheaded the agency’s strategic planning initiatives, modernized the agency’s software and overhauled its internal policies and procedures. “All of which,” she wrote on her website, “have created higher standards of service, performance and conduct throughout the agency.”

  Like her colleagues on the commission, Fielder voted to approve [NorthWestern Energy’s rate increase](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/10/25/public-service-commission-approves-northwestern-energy-rate-hike/) in 2023, a decision that has drawn criticism from NorthWestern’s customers. Fielder defended that vote in a later proceeding that upheld the rate increase.

  ​​“I wish that prices across the board were not up so high in this country the way they are, but I believe the commission did its best that it could with the parameters that have been given to use under the law,” Fielder said. 

  Fielder didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on material from Fielder’s campaign website and media coverage of commission proceedings.
