summaryNarrative: |
  Allen, 65 as of Election Day, has spent the past four decades working at various levels of public education, most recently as the principal and superintendent at Harrison Public School in Madison County. Prior to that role, Allen served as deputy state superintendent under Elsie Arntzen, routinely representing the Office of Public Instruction in education policy discussions at the Legislature and before the Board of Public Education. Allen left the agency in July 2023.

  Allen was born in Choteau and raised in Fairfield. She got her start in school administration in the Augusta Public Schools, and from there went on to jobs at multiple other districts in Montana and Arizona. During her time at OPI, Allen says she led efforts to establish new approaches to teacher retention and student assessment and worked with state lawmakers, higher education leaders and local public school administrators on a range of other initiatives. She has emphasized student safety and parental rights as core issues in her campaign.

  “We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of our kids,” Allen said, “and we need someone at the OPI that will fight for a bright future for each one of our kids while getting false philosophies out of what our kids experience.”
