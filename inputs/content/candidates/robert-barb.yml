  Barb, a Green Party candidate, says he “walks the walk” when it comes to supporting the environment and living with “ecological wisdom,” one of the party's tenets. “I have lived ‘off the grid’ in the mountains of Western Montana for decades in concert with the environment and with a minimalist footprint,” he wrote on his campaign website. “I mostly hunt and fish, and I grow most of my own food.”

  He says he opposes both major parties because they ignore such wisdom. He supports decriminalizing cannabis and a ceasefire and two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

  “One of Jon Tester’s greatest failures is his inaction on the continued Israeli assault on Gaza, and his refusal to support a ceasefire,” Barb wrote. “I’m running for the United States Senate to provide an alternative for the hundreds of thousands of Montanans who want to see an end to the Israeli occupation of Gaza and an end to war.”

  Barb did not respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on Barb’s campaign website.
