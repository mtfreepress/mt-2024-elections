summaryNarrative: |
  Wilson, 60 as of Election Day, has been a Flathead County state district court judge since 2017, a position he took following several years as a county justice of the peace.

  “Judges at all levels of our justice system should be able to consider and understand the viewpoints of all parties to a case,” Wilson told MTFP. “I believe my experience both as an attorney and trial court judge has prepared me well for a seat on the Montana Supreme Court, which requires its members to understand the viewpoints of all parties so that every case can be decided fully and fairly according to the law.”

  Before becoming a judge, Wilson was a prosecutor and private practice attorney for a wide range of clients.

  Wilson told MTFP he’s running to bring a “common sense perspective and Montana values” to the bench.

  “Whether Montanans are content or disappointed with various decisions by our Supreme Court in recent years, the stakes for Montanans and our Constitution are the same, regardless of the year or the election,” Wilson told MTFP. “The question is whether we will have a Court seen as respectful of the Constitution and the rule of law —  including the law of precedent —  or whether we will have one seen as stepping outside of its own boundaries.”

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Wilson as well as prior MTFP reporting.
