summaryNarrative: |
  Bogner, 37 as of Election Day, was born and raised in Miles City, which he currently represents as a state Senator. He says he is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who was deployed twice to Iraq.

  Bogner says he’s campaigning this year because he’s frustrated by how the Biden administration handled the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and how it’s handling the security of the U.S.-Mexico border. 

  “[A]s a Marine, I could not stand by and watch those national security failures without doing anything,” he said.

  This biography is based on written information provided by Bogner.
