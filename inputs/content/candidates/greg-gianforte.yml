summaryNarrative: |
  Greg Gianforte, 63 as of Election Day, was elected as Montana’s governor in 2020, the first Republican to hold the position in 16 years in 2020. He originally ran for governor in 2016, losing to Democratic incumbent Steve Bullock. Gianforte was later elected as Montana’s at-large U.S. representative in 2017 and reelected in 2018.

  A former technology entrepreneur who built Bozeman-based RightNow Technologies [into a $1.5 billion business](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/pressrelease/oracle-buys-rightnow-102411.html) before selling it to Oracle in 2011, Gianforte has cut income taxes, capital gains taxes and reduced tax burdens for business equipment during his first term. He has signed into law government restrictions on abortion, religious freedom protections and school choice policies, and also established task forces intended to address housing affordability issues and property taxes.

  In his campaign for a second term, Gianforte is pledging to grow Montana’s economy and rein in government regulations.

  “For too long, Montana hasn’t lived up to our full, outstanding potential, and while we’ve made great progress to reach our potential over the last three years, there’s still more to do to create more good-paying Montana jobs, boost opportunities for all Montanans and protect our Montana way of life,” Gianforte told MTFP.

  Gianforte pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in 2017 after he physically attacked a journalist in the closing days of his 2017 congressional campaign. He [was also formally warned by state game wardens](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/govt-and-politics/gianforte-says-he-made-mistake-trapping-wolf-without-certification-class/article_220c5e44-4f02-516f-a8db-210a1fcbb0c4.html) after trapping a wolf in 2021 without completing a required certification course and fined $70 in 2000 after self-reporting that he had shot a spike bull elk in a district where hunting was restricted to brow-tined bulls, according to Lee Newspapers.  

  This biography is based on MTFP’s reporting on Gianforte’s first term, media reports, and other existing public records.
