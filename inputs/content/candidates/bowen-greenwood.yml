summaryLine: Incumbent Montana Supreme Court clerk
summaryNarrative: |
  Greenwood, 53 as of Election Day, has served as clerk of the Montana Supreme Court since his election to this position in 2018. 

  “We make every last one of the court's legal documents available to the public, and that's work I believe in,” he told MTFP. “The people have a right to know what their court is doing. Transparency and sunshine are fundamental goods in every branch of government.”

  He’s also a Republican official who has previously served as executive director of the state GOP. He says that experience makes him an asset to the conservative cause — the clerk, unlike the justiceships on the Supreme Court itself, is a partisan position, and Greenwood says that’s a good thing. When Republican state officials or their attorneys come before the Supreme Court, Greenwood is “right at their side” helping them prepare, he said.

  “The Clerk of the Montana Supreme Court is a partisan office, and thank God. In a Montana Supreme Court where extremist, progressive ideologues rule the day, Republicans must preserve every advantage we can get,” he told MTFP. “I am the only Republican anywhere near that court. We cannot risk losing the gains we've made.”

  This biography is based on materials provided to MTFP by Greenwood as well as prior MTFP reporting.
