  O’Brien, 55 as of Election Day, has served in several roles in Montana’s education system for over a decade, including as a parent and a state lawmaker. She was an education policy advisor to former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and oversaw the two-year campus at Missoula College as dean from 2015 to 2017. During the past two sessions of the Montana Legislature, she has also worked on education policy as a Democrat representing Missoula’s Senate District 46.

  O’Brien grew up in the Pacific Northwest and moved to Montana 16 years ago, where she says she has long-standing family roots in the Gallatin and Missoula valleys.

  As she campaigns, she cites her experience as a former social studies teacher and mother to a Missoula high school student. She also says she said she’s worked across the aisle in the Legislature on issues impacting kindergarten readiness, student safety and the state’s ongoing teacher shortage.

  “I am ‘all-in’ on Montana public education and look forward to being the state leader our school’s deserve,” O’Brien said.
