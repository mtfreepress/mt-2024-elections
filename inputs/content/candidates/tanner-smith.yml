  Smith, 49 as of Election Day, is a Lakeside resident who represented House District 11 in the 2023 Legislature as a freshman lawmaker. While in the Legislature, he served on the House Fish, Wildlife and Parks Committee, House Taxation Committee, House Transportation Committee, and the Joint Fish, Wildlife & Parks and Senate Fish & Game Committee. 

  He sponsored four bills during the 2023 session, including one that would have limited the location of marijuana dispensaries, though none passed into law. 

  As he campaigns for governor, he has pledged to represent conservative Republican values, crack down on crime and drug trafficking, reduce homeowner property taxes and expand natural resource production.

  “The Montana my children are growing up in is nothing like the Montana I grew up in,” Smith told MTFP.

  Smith owns his own construction business in Lakeside, where he lives with his wife and five children. Smith was a school board trustee for Somers Lakeside School District 29 but resigned in January 2023. He grew up in Stevensville.
