  Ophus, 31 as of Election Day, is a student at Montana State University Northern and veteran of the U.S. Navy. 

  Although he’s filed to run as a Democrat, Ophus said he believes the clerk’s work should be non-partisan, and that his goal is to “support the court in its regulation of state law, ensure that the cases before the court are scheduled and properly monitored, to maintain the court’s files and to report the statistics relating to the court's activities in a manner that is transparent and direct.”

  He said he is dedicated to a life of service, whether that means representing voters as the court clerk or some other avenue, but he wanted to make sure that the Democratic primary for the clerkship was robust and competitive. 

  “I do not seek power and authority by nature,” he said. “I do not view such an office as a vehicle to pursue grander ambitions nor am I willing to submit myself to the corruption of money in politics through the acceptance of the legalized bribery of campaign donations from corporate PAC's. That I lack ambition more than any other trait is my chief qualification.”
