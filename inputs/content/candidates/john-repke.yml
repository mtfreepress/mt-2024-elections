summaryNarrative: |
  Repke is a business executive who was born in Illinois and has lived full time in Whitefish for 10 years. Repke, 67 as of Election Day, received both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business finance and spent 40 years working in the field.

  Prior to an unsuccessful bid for the Montana Public Service Commission in 2022, Repke worked as the chief financial officer for SmartLam, a wood products manufacturer based in Columbia Falls. Repke held executive-level positions at HAVI Global Logistics and Waste Management, Inc. Repke said his professional experience has familiarized him with insurance programs, self-funded employee health plans and risk management generally.

  “As a lifelong consumer of insurance products, I value the protections offered by the policies, but also understand the frustrations of dealing with the complexities of purchasing coverages and dealing with the claims processes,” Repke said. “This is especially true with medical insurance where I have direct experience handling the insurance matters related to my late wife’s long, difficult battle with pancreatic cancer.”

  Repke said he’s actively engaged in his community and in organizations focused on public land access. He added that he believes that “keeping Montana the last, best place’ for [his] grandkids’ generation” requires a commitment to the integrity of state government.
