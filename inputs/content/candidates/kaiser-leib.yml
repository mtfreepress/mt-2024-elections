  Kaiser Lieb, 37 as of Election Day, is a Helena resident and professional software developer. He is also a standup comedian. 

  Born in Kalispell, Lieb studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Montana, graduating in 2009. He has worked for SoFi, Juniper Square and Stage, a now-defunct venture-capitalist backed company Lieb founded in Helena. 

  Lieb has says he wants voters to have the option of a Montana-born-and-raised candidate, noting incumbent Republican Greg Gianforte and Democrat challenger Ryan Busse, the race’s frontrunners, were both born in other states.

  “When somebody comes here from someplace else, they bring their own views, they bring their own approach to living life,” he told MTFP. “That might not be what Montanans expect.”

  Lieb said he does not support additional limitations on firearms, citing his experience teaching rifle marksmanship with Project Appleseed, and also does not support restrictions on abortion, drugs or transgender rights.

  This biography is based on Lieb’s LinkedIn profile, comments to MTFP and campaign website.
