summaryNarrative: |
  Brown is the outgoing president of the Montana Public Service Commission, the state’s elected utility board. Brown, 53 as of Election Day, is a graduate of Beaverhead County High School who served as a congressional aide in Washington, D.C. and ran a private legal practice prior to his election to the PSC. 

  “My Montana roots, my extensive educational training, and my 30-plus years of work experience have prepared me to be a highly effective state auditor from day one,” Brown told MTFP. “I have an extensive background in protecting Montanans from insurance and securities fraud while regulating those who work in these important industries fairly and impartially.”

  Brown said he knows “what it means to sign both the front and back of a check” as a small business owner and would work to ensure “robust competition” and a “healthy regulatory environment” for Montana’s insurance industry if elected auditor.

  Brown is in the last year of his first four-year PSC term. He also made an unsuccessful run for the Montana Supreme Court in 2022. 

  This biography is based on Brown’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire and past media coverage.
