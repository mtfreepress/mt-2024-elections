summaryNarrative: |
  Busse, 54 as of Election Day, spent 25 years working as a salesman for the firearm company Kimber. He left his position as vice president of sales in 2020 and published a memoir, “Gunfight,” criticizing radicalization in the firearms industry the following year.

  Busse, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and grew up on his family’s ranch in northwestern Kansas, has lived in the Flathead Valley since 1995. Busse has said his time in Montana has helped shape his identity as an environmental and conservation advocate. He previously served as a volunteer board member and board chair for both Backcountry Hunters & Anglers and Montana Conservation Voters.

  “My Montana is a place where hardworking people make a good living for themselves, raise their kids with equal opportunity,” Busse said in his first campaign video. “Unfortunately the Montana that I love, and that my kids have been raised in, is being threatened right now.”

  Busse has not previously held elected office. As he has campaigned for governor, Busse has pledged to make property taxes more equitable, stabilize school funding and protect reproductive rights and abortion access. 

  Busse was cited for hunting birds without a license in 1998, [according to Lee Newspapers](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/ryan-busse-hunting-without-a-license-montana-governor/article_feb48cc0-7cec-11ee-abfe-178dd3bce54d.html), paying a $120 fine. He has said he made a mistake about which combination of hunting licenses he needed to purchase. 

  This biography is based on Busse’s memoir, responses to MTFP and his campaign materials.
