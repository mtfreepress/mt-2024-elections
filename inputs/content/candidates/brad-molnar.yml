  Molnar, 74 as of Election Day, is a longtime state lawmaker from Laurel who previously served on the PSC from 2005 to 2012.

  Molnar said he plans to give up his Montana Senate seat — he is in the midst of his second term — “because this is my passion and where I can do the most good.” He currently sits on the Senate Energy and Taxation committees.

  Molnar said he’s willing to have an “open mind” about the matters that come before the PSC and prioritizes the needs and concerns of his constituents over lobbyists working for the companies the commission regulates. During his tenure at the Capitol, he’s developed a reputation as [a lawmaker willing to vote against his party](https://apps.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2023/lawmakers/Brad-Molnar/#floor-statistics).

  “I’m going to win the fights I can win in the battle that is the biggest battle in Montana that nobody recognizes,” Molnar said. “I do, and I’m going to fight it.”

  Molnar said he has remained engaged with the commission’s work and would like to see the PSC work with NorthWestern Energy, the state’s largest regulated power monopoly, on long-range planning.

  While serving on the PSC, Molnar was fined $200 in 2011 for leaving the scene of a collision where he backed his pickup into a high schooler’s car in the parking lot of a Laurel Burger King. [According to Lee Newspapers](https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/psc-commissioner-molnar-pleads-no-contest-to-hit-and-run/article_03b36c7c-8878-11e0-99f4-001cc4c03286.html), he told law enforcement he didn’t realize he needed to exchange information because he didn’t believe the high schooler’s car was worth more than $500. 

  This biography is based on an MTFP’s interview with Molnar, past media coverage and Molnar’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire.
