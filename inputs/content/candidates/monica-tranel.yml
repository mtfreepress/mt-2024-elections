  Tranel, 58 as of Election Day, is a Missoula-based attorney who specializes in utility and energy issues. She says she was born in Wyoming and grew up in Miles City, Ashland, Broadview and Billings. She also competed as a rower in the 1996 and 200 summer Olympics.

  Tranel previously made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2022, losing to now-incumbent U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke. She also made a bid for the Montana Public Service Commission in 2020.

  This year, she says she’s running in an effort to address cost-of-living challenges like rising housing prices. 

  “I will bring this problem-solving approach to the issues we face here in Montana, and be a voice for the missing middle — the people who want to get things done for the betterment of our community,” she said in a statement.
