summaryNarrative: |
  Zinke, 63 as of Election Day, has represented western Montana in Congress since last year. He says he was born in Bozeman and raised in Whitefish on a property where his family has lived for four generations. He is also a retired U.S. Navy SEAL commander.

  Zinke served as President Donald Trump’s Secretary of the Interior from 2017 to 2018. He previously served as a state legislator and was initially elected to represent what was then a statewide congressional district in 2014.

  As he campaigns for re-election this year, Zinke describes himself as a “Reagan optimist” who believes the nation’s problems can be addressed “despite the mess (President) Biden has created in our economy, border, and national security.”

  Federal investigations of Zinke’s tenure at the Interior department found he mislead investigators [about his role in a Whitefish land deal](https://www.oversight.gov/sites/default/files/oig-reports/DOI/WebReactFormerSecretaryEthicalNoncompliance.pdf) and about the department’s [decision not to act on a gaming application from two Native American tribes](https://www.doioig.gov/sites/default/files/2021-migration/WebRedacted_FormerSecretaryandCOSDidntComplyWithDutyofCandor.pdf) while serving as secretary. Zinke has criticized both investigations as politically motivated.

  This biography is based on written material submitted by the Zinke campaign and past MTFP reporting.
