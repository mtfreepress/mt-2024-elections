summaryNarrative: |
  Krautter, 36 as of Election Day, is a Billings attorney. He grew up in Deer Lodge and earned his law degree from the University of Montana.

  Krautter served a term representing the Sidney area in the Montana Legislature as a Republican from 2019 to 2010, losing a re-election bid to a hardline Republican challenger. Krautter is the only candidate in the GOP primary field who has said he will not vote for Donald Trump if he’s the Republican nominee in the upcoming presidential election, offering at a recent Yellowstone County party event that he will write in a candidate.

  As he campaigns this year, he is touting his experience living in both rural eastern Montana and the state’s largest city.

  “I’m running for Congress to bring a new generation of leadership to Washington that will crush chaos and restore economic and social stability to our nation,” he said.

  This biography is based on materials submitted by Krautter’s campaign and prior MTFP reporting.
