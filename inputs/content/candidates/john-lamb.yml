  Lamb, a father of 12, grew up in an Amish-Mennonite community in Indiana before eventually settling near Norris.

  He previously made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2022, campaigning as the Libertarian nominee in the state’s western congressional district. He has also run for the Montana Legislature in the past.

  On his personal website, he describes himself as “100% prolife” and says he opposes all state and federal gun laws. He also advocates for abolishing all restrictions on international immigration.

  Lamb didn’t respond to MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire. This biography is based on MTFP reporting on his 2022 congressional campaign and information from [his personal website](https://johnlamblastfreeman.com).
