summaryNarrative: |
  Hayes, 70 as of Election Day, told MTFP he was born in Oklahoma, moved to Montana in 2004 and currently lives in Townsend.

  He said he is running for office in an effort to advocate for small-scale miners, loggers and ranchers who are having their use of public lands curtailed by federal authorities.

  “I know how corrupt this government is,” Hayes said in a written statement to MTFP. “I've been fighting with the forest service for going on 10 years on their corruption and lies.”

  This biography is based on materials Hayes provided to MTFP via a written questionnaire.
