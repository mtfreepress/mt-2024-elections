summaryNarrative: |
  Knudsen, 43 as of Election Day, says he’s spent his first term increasing crime fighting resources to state and local law enforcement agencies and fighting federal policies that “run roughshod over our rights.” 

  The Republican, a former speaker of the State House and Roosevelt County Attorney, was elected attorney general in 2020, the same year voters gave Republicans control of both the Legislature and governor’s office for the first time since the mid-2000s. He has since been most visible as the face of Republican state government in court, mounting defenses to constitutional challenges against dozens of Republican-backed laws and joining national lawsuits against Biden Administration policies — more than 40, by his count. 

  “I'm running for reelection so that I can continue to fight drugs and crime in our communities, fight the disastrous Biden agenda that has harmed Montanans, and fight for Montanans’ freedoms and liberties,” he said. 

  Knudsen currently faces a [complaint from Montana’s attorney ethics organization](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/09/05/montana-ag-austin-knudsen-accused-of-violating-rules-of-professional-conduct/) due to his office's defiance of a court order during a 2021 separation of powers fight. Knudsen’s office has branded the complaint a campaign season-motivated “political stunt” designed to persecute a difference in political opinion.
