summaryNarrative: |
  Willoughby, 63 as of Election Day, transitioned to working in the insurance industry after a 20-year career in law enforcement. He sells home, auto and life insurance through Willoughby Insurance Services in Helena and also founded Bad Boy Bail bonds. 

  Willoughby Montana’s top auditor should be someone “who has actually worked in the insurance industry,” Willoughby said, adding he’d like to put a stop to politicians “using the office for their own political gain.” 

  Willoughby has worked in the insurance industry for 25 years and dubs himself as “the consumers’ voice in the insurance industry.” He said aggressively soliciting more insurance providers will help Montanans find more affordable coverage options.

  “I have prided myself in my service to the public and providing solutions to everyday problems people encounter,” he said.

  This biography is based on Willoughby’s response to MTFP’s questionnaire, information on his business websites and media coverage of the state auditor race.
