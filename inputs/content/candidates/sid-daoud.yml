  Daoud, 57 as of Election Day, is a Libertarian who says he hopes to usher in a new era of representation for Montana in the U.S. Senate.

  He says being a third-party candidate means he won’t be beholden to any major party leader and will vote his conscience no matter who is in the White House, though he acknowledged more alignment with Trump than Biden. 

  “I will be forced to work with whichever flavor of administration we have, but I will be consistent in upholding and voting my principles,” Daoud said. “Coincidentally my principles align with the principles of Montana and all I need to fall back on are the same lessons I grew up learning in our great state.”

  Daoud said he wants to dramatically reduce federal spending, restore the federal appropriations process to regular order and cut government programs. As a Libertarian, he said he also believes in ending American military aid to foreign countries. 

  “I’m a Montanan with a rich family history, representing two American dreams,” he said. “On my mother’s side, the dream of early settlers in territorial Montana, and on my father’s, that of an Armenian immigrant, coming to America to work hard and make a new life.”

  This biography is based on material Daoud provided to MTFP.
