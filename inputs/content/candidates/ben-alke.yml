summaryNarrative: |
  Alke, 45 as of Election Day, is a Bozeman-based attorney who says he’s running for attorney general to restore “integrity and competence” to an office he says has been sidelined from its constitutional mission by its current occupant. 

  Alke, who describes himself as a centrist, has positioned his campaign in direct opposition to Knudsen, characterizing Knudsen’s aggressive involvement in partisan politics as a distraction from the office’s core mission of prosecuting crimes and defending the state in court.

  “The state is not stepping up to provide help where it is needed most,” Alke told MTFP. “For example, Lake County does not have the resources to prosecute felonies on the Flathead Reservation and there are around 2,000 outstanding warrants. The attorney general needs to spend more time fighting crime and less time on politics.”

  Alke, who began his legal career clerking for then-Montana Supreme Court Justice Brian Morris and later worked with prominent liberal constitutional attorney Jim Goetz, now is a partner specializing in commercial litigation at Crist, Krogh, Alke & Nord. 

  Despite being a Democrat, Alke says he’d work with every legislator to defend laws they pass in court regardless of their party.

  “I am not a career politician, an activist or an extremist,” he said. “I am a highly qualified, experienced attorney who wants to serve the best interests of all Montanans and get things done.”
