summaryNarrative: |
  Downing, 57, is the state’s current state auditor and commissioner of securities and insurance. He has previously worked in the technology, insurance and real estate industries.

  Downing grew up in California but has had a home in Montana since 1998. He says he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and Air National Guard after the September 11 terrorist attacks and served two tours of duty in Afghanistan.

  Although Downing has spent much of his time in Montana living in the state’s western congressional district — places like Gallatin Gateway and Big Sky — he lives in Helena in his capacity as a state official. 

  Downing has served as Montana’s state auditor, or securities and insurance commissioner, since 2021. He chose to make a bid for Congress this year instead of pursuing a second four-year term in that role.

  In public statements about his candidacy, Downing has focused on concerns about the southern border and inflation. He has also touted his business and military experience.

  “I think that’s what voters want,” he [told MTN News](https://www.ktvh.com/replacing-rosendale/troy-downing-republican-candidate-for-montanas-eastern-u-s-house-seat) in an interview published in May. “They want somebody who is going to show up, roll up their sleeves, do the work — that understands what it’s like to build a business, understand what it’s like to go to war, understands what it’s like to sign the front of a payroll check.

  Downing [pleaded guilty in 2018](https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/govt-and-politics/former-us-senate-candidate-acknowledges-hunting-violations/article_3523a095-5b50-5da2-a616-039c370fc8df.html?gv=1) to two misdemeanor charges of obtaining resident hunting licenses for several years while not officially a Montana resident. At the time, Downing argued the matter was the result of his accountants preparing tax forms that listed him as a California resident. According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, he was ordered to pay a $2,110 fine and forego hunting and fishing privileges for 18 months. 

  Downing’s campaign declined to provide responses for MTFP’s spring 2024 candidate questionnaire.
