  Through the 2024 election, Montana voters will select candidates to fill 14 Montana-specific federal and state offices — plus 100 House seats and 25 open Senate seats in the state Legislature.

  That can be a baffling process to track even for voters who diligently follow political news. This digital guide, a project of the nonpartisan **[Montana Free Press](https://montanafreepress.org/)** newsroom, is an effort to ensure basic information is available so voters have the opportunity to cast informed votes.

  The 2024 primary election, where voters picked political party nominees to advance to the General Election, was held **Tuesday, June 4**. The 2024 general election will be held **Tuesday, Nov. 5**.
overviewBallotInitiatives: |
  Issue votes can be placed on the November General Election ballot either by referral from the Legislature or by citizen initiative when backers clear voter signature-gathering thresholds.

  As of July 1, no issues had been formally qualified for the 2024 ballot. Backers of an issue that [would enshrine abortion rights in the Montana Contitution](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/04/05/montanas-constitutional-abortion-amendment-cleared-for-signature-gathering/) and two others [that would adjust how the state's elections are conducted](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/08/22/proposed-ballot-initiatives-would-mean-big-changes-for-montana-elections/), have said publicly that they believe they have collected enough signature for their measures to qualify. 

  To qualify their initiatives for the 2024 ballot, backers needed to submit enough signatures to county election administrators by **June 21, 2024**. A complete list of proposed 2024 initiatives and their status is available [on the Montana Secretary of State's website](https://sosmt.gov/elections/ballot_issues/proposed-2024-ballot-issues/).

overviewLegislatureLedeIn: |
  Montanans elect 100 state representatives to two-year terms and 25 of 50 state senators to four-year terms in each even-year election. This year's election is the first to be conducted using [a new legislative district map](https://montanafreepress.org/2023/02/13/montana-redistricting-commission-finalizes-new-house-senate-maps/) drawn to account for population shifts recorded by the 2020 census. 

  Each Senate district is composed of two House districts.

  Answers here were solicited from candidates via a written questionnaire conducted by MTFP in April 2024. Responses were limited to 1,000 characters and edited lightly for punctuation and spelling. Candidates were asked to focus on the positives their service would bring the state instead of making rhetorical attacks on their opponents. Responses have not been exhaustively fact-checked.

  November general election ballots may also include other items such as county commission races, depending on where in the state you live. June 2024 ballots also asked voters whether they wished to set up [local government study commissions](https://www.montana.edu/extension/localgov/mtvoterreview/index.html) to review the structure of their city and county governments.
