  description: |-
    The first of two initiatives advanced by Montanans for Election Reform, a backer group that says its proposals would discourage extremism in Montana politics. It would would replace Montana’s current party-based June primary elections with a fully open primary that sends the top four vote-getters from a party-agnostic ballot onward to November general elections.

    The second of two initiatives advanced by Montanans for Election Reform. It would specify that candidates must receive at least 50% of the November general election vote in order to be declared a winner, as opposed to the current system where the winner is simply the candidate who receives the most votes. The Montana Legislature would be responsible for determining how to address races where no candidate wins an outight majority, with backers saying the Legislature could adopt either an Alaska-style ranked-choice voting system or Georgia-style runoff elections.

- number: Constitutional Initiative 128
  description: |-
    An abortion rights initiative advanced by a backer group, Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, that aims to solidify abortion access in Montana. It would create a new section of the Montana Constitution that explicitly establishes a right “to carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion." The Constitution would also be amended to specify that the explict abortion right "shall not be denied or burdened unless justified by a compelling government interest achieved by the least restrictive means."
