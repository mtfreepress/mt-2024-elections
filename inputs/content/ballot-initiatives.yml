- number: Constitutional Initiative 126
  description: |-
    The first of [two proposed amendments to the state Constitution](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/10/04/twin-constitutional-initiatives-aim-to-make-montana-elections-more-competitive/) advanced by Montanans for Election Reform. It would replace Montana’s current party-based June primary system, where voters receive multiple party-specific ballots, with a single primary ballot listing all candidates regardless of party. CI-126 would send the top four vote-getters in each race on to November’s general election, again regardless of party.

    The change would only apply to elections for federal, statewide and legislative offices. Proponents argue CI-126 would discourage extremism and dampen outside financial influence in Montana politics, while opponents claim it would increase the power of extremism and outside money in political campaigns.

    The second of [two proposed constitutional amendments](https://montanafreepress.org/2024/10/04/twin-constitutional-initiatives-aim-to-make-montana-elections-more-competitive/) advanced by Montanans for Election Reform. It would specify that candidates must receive more than 50% of the November general election vote in order to be declared a winner, as opposed to the current system where the winner is simply the candidate who receives the most votes. CI-127 tasks the Montana Legislature with adopting laws for determining how to address races where no candidate wins an outright majority. 

    The change would only apply to elections for federal, statewide and legislative offices. Backers contend the change would hold elected officials accountable to a broader swath of Montana voters, and allow the Legislature to adopt either an Alaska-style ranked-choice voting system or Georgia-style runoff elections. Opponents argue that the Legislature’s adoption of either scenario would increase the time and cost of administering a general election at the expense of Montana taxpayers.

  description: |-
    An abortion rights initiative advanced by a backer group, Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, that aims to solidify abortion access in Montana. It would create a new section of the Montana Constitution that explicitly establishes a right “to carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion." The Constitution would also be amended to specify that the explict abortion right "shall not be denied or burdened unless justified by a compelling government interest achieved by the least restrictive means."
