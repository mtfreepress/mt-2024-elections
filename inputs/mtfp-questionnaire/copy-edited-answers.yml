    - question: What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        It is the same problem that plagues the entire country. Crony capitalism, corruption in government to include Congress and people in power throughout our government that never seem to be held accountable. Much of this can be corrected with a balance budget amendment similar to the one that Jon Tester voted against in 2011. Our country holds the position of being in control of the reserve currency of the world. Our leadership has debased our currency by borrowing $35 trillion. This must stop. It is at the core of the corruption. It is also at the core of inflation, the most insidious tax on poor people. We must insist on a balanced budget amendment, restrict any person over the age of 74 from serving in the Federal government, and term limits of 12 years in Congress. We need voting laws that are beyond reproach. We need a federal clearing house for candidates so the voter can be well informed, and the candidates held responsible for what they say.
    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?
      response: |+
        I believed Joe Biden when he said in 2020, He would only run for one term of office. I believed Joe Biden when he said Kamala Harris was qualified to be president if anything was to happen to him. The problem with old people is they forget what they tell people, and they are the last to know when it's time to quit. Just like George W. Bush said no more nation building when he was running for office, that didn't work out for the people. Our Senate is evenly split, giving each senator a unique position of power. The Senate confirms the presidents appointments to cabinet positions. I will not confirm any cabinet officer that will not answer direct questions with direct answers. The same for federal judges. I am not partisan, my only loyalty is to the people, and the country. I am of the opinion that Joe Biden is past his prime and that he should step aside and let Kamala Harris become president. He said she was qualified. This is the time to find out, we the people need to know.
    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        In many ways Donald Trump provides evidence of his narcissism just like Joe Biden does. His ability to make cabinet appointments is also suspect. Ryan Zinke was no better prepared for interior secretary than the tiny little electrical company in his hometown that he was trying to hire to rebuild Puerto Rico's electrical grid. The president must work with Congress. Congress does not seek his approval, but he must seek our approval. The more independent a senator is from his party, the greater the influence he will have on the process. Jon Tester operates in lockstep with the Democrat leadership and that is why he has been ineffectual after 18 years. He refused to work with Donald Trump, nothing’s changed. There are things I can work on with Trump. Such as the southern border and immigration control. Maybe we can get our balanced budget amendment. We must move our country forward.
    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Please do not mischaracterize these statements. They are a starting point for negotiation on very important issues. Social Security and Medicare are currently not part of the deficit. They do need reform, they will be insolvent in less than nine years. We currently borrow approximately half of what we spend each year. Everything must be visited. We must stop lying to our people so they can rise to the occasion and understand the problems our current leadership has put us in. I support both, spending cuts and tax increases. It will take bold honest discussions and debates open to the public to resolve this issue. Either way there are dark days ahead of us. This will be our moment as a nation to come together and like our founding fathers we must make changes now to guide our country into the future and protect the Republic. A key component of this will be returning sovereignty and responsibility to the states. Sacrifices will be required, it is unthinkable not to succeed.
    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        There have been many opportunities since 1973 for both parties to fix this problem. Neither one of them wanted to lose abortion as a wedge issue to drive us apart. While the Supreme Court provided pro choice with the opportunity to compromise with pro life and craft a piece of legislation both could live with, it was wasted. Now pro life is in the driver seat and it is unlikely they will craft a bill to compromise with pro choice. My starting point on the issue would be no state should restrict a woman's right to have an abortion in the first trimester. Rape and incest carve out. If two doctors are willing to sign off on an unviable pregnancy up to the sixth month, it should be granted. This should be a baseline and beyond this each state should have complete control of the abortion issue. It is unlikely the federal government will ever get involved with abortion based on past performance. It is now a states’ rights issue. It will remain so until the Supreme Court takes it up again.
    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        The federal government should not get involved in affordable housing. Affordable housing is a regional problem. Best solved by the states. The federal government is in debt over $34 trillion. The federal government does not have money to spend on another issue. I was listening to the California Senate debate. Rep. Barbara Lee stated that if she won the Senate seat she would get $100 billion of funding for much-needed housing in California. Now you know why we are $34 trillion in debt. What Congress can do to affect the housing crisis is simply to balance the budget. This would drive inflation down and stabilize the cost of interest to purchase a home. Everything is interlinked. We have a housing shortage, yet we leave our southern border open and invite 9 million people into our country. We could drive the cost of building a house down if we harvested more timber instead of letting it burn.
    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Climate change is real, but it will most likely not be the cause of our extinction. Congress has not gotten anything right in the last 80 years, so why would you think they know what they're talking about this time. Keeling is responsible for the first carbon dioxide measurements of the atmosphere in 1958. It measured 313 ppm and is currently at 414 ppm. That's only 25% increase of our current carbon dioxide level in 66 years. I suspect the reason they are using this as the bogeyman to try and scare us is simply because Congress doesn't blame any one particular industry beyond transportation for the problem. Transportation uses only 15% of the total petroleum products. Pollution is the bigger problem that Congress does not want to address. Instead Congress has assisted our corporations in shipping the pollution overseas. There are over 1 million abandoned oil wells spewing methane that is 28 times more toxic to the environment than carbon dioxide. This is a threat to our environment.
    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        This has been a problem for my entire life. We must seal the southern border completely. We need to re-examine all of our refugee and immigration programs. Immigration is a three to one loss for the federal government and state agencies. We simply do not have the money to support an immigrant population. It's not about compassion it's about common sense. We the people of this country have a culture. It has eroded due to bad policies of our federal government. Our government needs to stop sanctioning countries in an effort to destroy their economies. This does not make our people safer it just makes our politicians more powerful and dangerous. This is behavior that must be corrected in our state department. Middle East condition since 9/11 2001 are a prime example. Only a fool or politician would say it's a safer place. We have destroyed entire nations with our intervention. We must bring all of our military home to protect our boarders and the American people.
    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        In 2000 a family of four's health care was about $6500 per year, 2010 affordable health care act was passed. At that time insurance was approximately $12,500. In 2020 it had increased by over $10,000 a year. That certainly does not seem very affordable to me. We still have tens of millions uninsured. A document, 1,000s of pages controlling our health care, Congress and Jon Tester did not read it. When Trump was president Tester could've revisited the problem, but he just voted no on repealing it. The medical industry reports record profits at the expense of the people. I cannot think of one thing that Congress has managed well. For this reason single-payer scares the hell out of me. If we are to balance our budget and move our country forward then everything must be examined. I do not have the answer for this one, yet. One thing is for sure, we must get it right this time. Other countries have models that we can explore, we do not have to reinvent the wheel.
    - question: Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?
      response: |+
        We should allow our military industrial complex to sell arms to countries in order to protect their borders. It should be controlled by Congress. The keyword is sell, not provide them with the money to purchase. If we are to save our country from economic chaos and therefore the world from economic chaos. We must stop the policy of interfering in other countries issues. There have been more people killed in the past 60 years because of our intervention. It is a contributor to our $34 trillion debt. We should revisit every treaty we are involved in. Some will stand and some will need to be renegotiated. We need a strong navy, a well-trained expeditionary force, and a domestic force designed for the defense of our nation. We must harden our space and cyber defense. Once our debt has been paid off in full we can revisit helping other countries. We have a responsibility to our country to provide peace and tranquility within our borders.

    - question: What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        We must bring accountability to D.C. Like many Montanans, I’m tired of hearing career politicians talk about how they’re going to “fight” for America while our problems only get worse.

        From our nation’s out-of-control debt, the crisis at our southern border, the broken VA, and the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, the career politicians and bureaucrats in D.C. are not being held accountable. It's time to remind Washington what it means to have service, sacrifice, and accountability at the center of your mission.

        That’s why one of my first actions as a candidate was to sign the Term Limits Pledge because we need more accountability and less career politicians. I’m committed to ensuring that politicians who fail to pass a balanced budget don’t get paid. And Montana veterans will have no bigger advocate than a fellow veteran to fight for them and fulfill the promise our nation made to them.

        Montanans have an opportunity to secure our children’s future and save America. Let’s take it.
    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?
      response: |+
        Our country is facing serious problems, and we need serious people to solve them. Record inflation, open borders, rising crime, collapsing foreign policy, unattainable housing prices and out-of-control debt. America is at a crossroads. Control of the U.S. Senate will decide if we can solve these problems to save the American Dream and deliver prosperity and growth while protecting our freedoms and liberties.

        As senator, I will work to end illegal immigration once and for all, rebuild our economy with low inflation, unleash American energy, get tough on crime, fix the VA and put America First.

        President Biden has failed our nation and is one of the worst presidents we’ve ever had. President Trump will win in November, and I look forward to working with him to deliver the commonsense policies Montanans want, and our country needs: safe streets, cheap gas, a secure border, America First foreign policy, a strong economy, a balanced budget, good schools, boys are boys and girls are girls.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I’m incredibly proud and honored to have the support of President Donald J. Trump as we fight to take back the Senate and save America. As conservative political outsiders and successful businessmen, we will always fight for Montanans and put America First!

        This race will determine control of the Senate, and with President Trump in office, the Senate is critical to advancing the America First agenda.

        We need political outsiders to deliver the commonsense solutions Montanans want, and our country needs, but career politicians back in D.C. haven’t delivered. Under President Trump’s leadership, our economy was booming, our border was secure, and America was respected on the world stage. Together, we will take on and defeat the D.C. establishment and career politicians selling out our country, rebuild our economy, secure the border, get tough on crime, re-establish peace through strength, restore Montana common sense in D.C., drain the swamp, and Make America Great Again!
    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        We are $34 trillion in debt. $34 trillion. The spending in Washington is out of control, and the career politicians are doing absolutely nothing to rein it in. Let’s be clear: We have a spending problem —  not a revenue problem.

        If we don’t fix our spending problem, we’ll be handing our children an insolvent nation, and the only thing our tax dollars will do is service our national debt. We must balance the budget and begin to lower our national debt. 
          
        The quickest way to balance the budget is to ensure that politicians who fail to pass a balanced budget don’t get paid. You’re not allowed to run your business that way, and they shouldn’t be allowed to run our nation that way. If politicians can’t pass a balanced budget, they shouldn’t get paid. No balanced budget, no paycheck!

        We must also start cutting wasteful spending that doesn’t put America First —  no more blank checks to Ukraine or sending billions to regimes, like Iran, that chant “Death to America!”
    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I am proudly pro-life and support commonsense protections for when a baby can feel pain, as well as exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, and I believe any further limits must be left to each state.

        Like most Montanans, I believe that allowing an elective abortion up until the moment of birth is an extreme position.

        I strongly believe in helping bring more life into this world, including through our philanthropy benefitting Montana health care, which helped bring the upgraded neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to the Gallatin Valley to provide critical care to at-risk infants and helping Billings Clinic establish Montana’s first level one trauma center.

        I also stand in support of IVF as a path for families to grow and thrive when they struggle to conceive naturally, like my brother and sister-in-law who battled infertility and eventually were blessed with my nephew through IVF. I will fight against any effort to restrict IVF treatments for women and families.
    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Record inflation has made the American Dream of homeownership tougher and tougher to achieve for Montanans. The reckless spending out of D.C. has given us record-high inflation, sky-high interest rates, higher building costs and rising prices on everything from homes to groceries. We need to rebuild our economy with low inflation. I will work to end the out-of-control spending and the disastrous economic policies that are crushing Montana families and small businesses.

        We must also start taking advantage of our abundant natural resources and building more homes with Montana timber. In the middle of a housing crisis, why are we buying our timber and shipping it in from foreign countries when we could be getting it for cheaper while growing our economy right here in Montana? It makes no sense.

        We should be able to responsibly manage our forests here at home to create more high-paying jobs, lower housing costs, support our communities, and protect the environment. That’s common sense.
    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        The climate has always been changing, but the Leftist Climate Cult agenda is not about the environment, it’s about control.

        We must stand strong against the radical climate cult agenda that senselessly kills Montana jobs, weakens our economy, crushes business, devastates our communities and strips Montanans of their freedoms by weaponizing ESG. As a public company’s CEO, I know personally how this woke crap is stripping us of our freedoms.

        We need to embrace commonsense policies that benefit the economy and environment simultaneously. It’s time to make America energy independent and dominant again by unleashing all forms of American energy and innovation and increasing active forest management. We should be able to responsibly develop those resources here at home to create more high-paying jobs, lower energy costs and support our communities, all while protecting the environment. This isn’t an either/or choice like the left would have you believe. We can do both.
    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        President Biden inherited a secure border but created the worst border crisis in our history.

        Congress could've held the Biden administration accountable for its disastrous policies in April by holding an impeachment trial for DHS Sec. Mayorkas and Jon Tester voted to dismiss it.

        As senator, I’ll fight to defend America, stop the invasion and keep deadly drugs, like Chinese fentanyl, off our streets. But let's be clear: Joe Biden created this crisis and he has the authority—without help from Congress—to fix it.

        We must stop incentivizing illegal immigration and restore President Trump’s successful policies of Remain in Mexico and ending Catch and Release. We can’t keep spending billions on handouts for illegals while we’re $34 trillion in debt, have homeless veterans on the street and hardworking Americans struggle to make ends meet.

        We need new, strong leadership to crush the cartels, finish the wall, seal the border, end illegal immigration once and for all and put America First!

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        Our health care system is broken. I hear it from Montanans in their communities across the state. Because of Obamacare, Montanans face higher premiums year after year. Americans have lost access to doctors and health care plans they were told they could keep.

        More government control of our health care has only made things worse. We must increase access and lower costs.

        Like most Montanans, I believe we need to promote greater transparency, competition and shopping for services in our health care system. As someone who was wounded in battle and has had to deal with the VA, I know firsthand we should be rewarding outcomes and innovation, improving access to care in our rural communities, and most importantly, protecting Montanans with pre-existing conditions.

        That's why I proudly donated millions across Montana to increase access to critical health care services, bring the upgraded NICU to the Gallatin Valley and help Billings Clinic establish Montana’s first level one trauma center.

    - question: Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?
      response: |+
        We must put America First. If we're going to send military support overseas, we better damn well know why we're doing it, the American people better be behind it, and it better benefit our national interest.

        We can't let the politicians back in Washington keep putting America Last and shoveling our resources, people and cash overseas as other countries take advantage of us. Everything we do as a country, domestically and internationally, should benefit the American people and serve our national interest, because when America acts in its own interest, the rest of the world benefits. When we're a strong America with a strong economy and a strong presence, everyone else benefits. We must get back to that. 

        Our government should always serve American interests and put Americans first. That's what America First means, and that's the type of commonsense leadership I'm going to fight for in the Senate.

    - question: What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        Our biggest issue is our out-of-control national debt and inflation. We must stop spending, pass an actual budget (which Congress [hasn't] done in 28 years) that includes paying down our debt. We must demand that the Federal Reserve stop printing money until we see deflation. We can cut our budget by reducing the number of federal agencies and programs they administer. All this must be done immediately as we are currently callously spending our future generations’ future.
    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?
      response: |+
        I will be forced to work with whichever flavor of administration we have, but I will be consistent in upholding and voting my principles. Coincidentally my principles align with the principles of Montana and all I need to fall back on are the same lessons I grew up learning in our great state. Essentially the ideal of being left alone — less government intervention, more self-reliance. I personally doubt that President Biden is in charge of his own mental faculties let alone the nation.
    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        Not being a Republican or Democrat has its advantages, as I am beholden to no party (not even my own) or political personality. Please see my previous response, although I think that I have a bit more alignment with President Trump.
    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        It is our number one priority. Absolutely no tax increases whatsoever. We can provide a balanced budget, with cuts across the board. We can also reduce the size of the federal government by reducing the number of federal agencies. I do not see the value in any agency created after 1970. Their roles can be folded into existing agencies. None of this will be fun, but it is necessary to dig us out of the hole we are in and get us all back to adherence to the Constitution.
    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I agree with the Supreme Court, abortion is not a federal issue. I however take it further; the government should be completely out of this issue.
    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        The best thing the federal government can do to address housing access for all is to start correcting our national debt, inflation and out of control spending. The local economy is affected by this critically. I face housing issues all the time on City Council here in Kalispell (the fastest-growing micropolitan city in the U.S.) and the only fix is to increase the number of units. We have done a great job in Kalispell to start addressing this with the units we have coming online. The national lockdown and Covid funding were crippling factors to this problem, and it is going to take bunch of hard work to correct this. The high cost of materials coupled with the scarcity of construction workers is a terrible combination.
    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Climate change has turned into a power grab by government entities around the world. If we in the U.S. are serious about reducing our impact, we should do it the American way by supporting and getting out of the way of innovation by entrepreneurs. Regulating and taxing will fail as it always does. I am very concerned with the not-so-hidden global effort of depopulation, that scares me more than anything around this issue.
    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        This is probably the biggest hot button issue facing federal candidates this year. Unfortunately, the leadership of the two big parties have no intention of fixing the issue as it keeps their base in line and focused on the left-right war. I would begin to attack this issue by immediately stopping all social welfare for immigrants. We have not given this in the past and no one should expect tax dollars to be taken and then distributed to non-citizens. If we are going to have a border policy, it should be consistent to every border and consistent between agencies tasked with enforcement (which it is not today). I don’t think anyone would disagree that we need immigration policy reform.
    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        The government needs to get out of the way. The best outcomes appear when there is little government involvement, and the free market can determine pricing (Lasik eye surgery is a great example of this). This is the only service that we engage with not knowing the cost to us until after the visit or procedure. Let the different providers compete with listed pricing and let insurance companies compete past state borders for a start.

    - question: Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?
      response: |+
        We should not. Period. We can only send aid at this time by increasing our debt or printing money (inflation) in other words we can only send support by hurting Americans to do it. If Congress is determined to support one side or the other, it can do its job and declare war. If we want to support wars in other countries the federal government can issue limited time special bonds, and let Americans decide if they wish to contribute of their own free will. We know when the bonds will mature and can budget for that. Our country cannot sustain all of the endless wars and troop deployments around the world, not to mention the severe impact this has on our veterans that return broken.

    - question: What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        There are many, but the most pressing for all fifty states is the border crisis. I will work tirelessly to codify the key elements of the Trump border policies. Finishing the wall, reinstating the "stay in Mexico"  policy, ending "catch and release" and deporting as many illegal aliens as reasonably possible should all be made a matter of law.

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?
      response: |+
        President Biden and I agree on virtually nothing when it comes to public policy. I see it as my responsibility as a senator to do everything I can to minimize the damage being done by the extreme progressive policies he is attempting to advance.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        Conversely, I agree with the vast majority of former President Trump's public policy positions. I will be completely committed to building alliances with my colleagues for the purpose of realizing those policy goals.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        We simply cannot spend America rich and federal spending must be brought under control. There are a number of things that should be done to accomplish that. Moving to zero based budgeting, eliminating continuing resolutions and omnibus budget bills, defunding several departments including Education, Energy and Commerce and passing a Balanced Budget  Amendment are among them. However, if we were to do away with all of the discretionary spending in the budget today, it would not be enough to bring it into balance. I will strive to be a catalyst for meaningful discussions regarding the reform of entitlement programs so that we can preserve  them for future generations in a fiscally responsible manner. There is, in my mind, absolutely no justification for any new taxes and I will oppose any attempt to levy them.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        For 50 years I argued that Rowe was bad law because abortion policy should be determined by the states. I still believe that. I am staunchly pro-life and would be supportive of state legislation restricting abortion but including exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        This is another issue that rightly resides with the states. Nowhere in the Constitution does it give the federal government the power to become a real-estate developer or landlord.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        The climate has always been and is today in flux. However, that change does not present an existential threat to our future. The hysteria surrounding the debate and the knee-jerk reactions that hysteria brings poses a far greater threat. The draconian "solutions" proposed in the "green new deal" and by this EPA are impossible to achieve and would cripple our economy. Private sector innovation and market forces will continue to lead us to attainable, sustainable and cleaner energy sources.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?

        I will work tirelessly to codify the key elements of the Trump border policies. Finishing the wall, reinstating the “stay in Mexico” policy, ending “catch and release” and deporting as many illegal aliens as reasonably possible should all be made a matter of law.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        We should return to a market-based health insurance system with the addition of a means tested voucher system to assist those individuals and families who genuinely need the help.

        First and foremost, military aid should be provided to another country only when a clear national interest has been identified. And then, that aid should be forthcoming only after we have assurances that there will be meaningful transparency and accountability regarding the use of the resources provided.

    - question: What do you see as the biggest issue Montana is facing that the Senate is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        Simply put, the Montana we know and love is changing. Everything from housing to groceries is more expensive as out-of-state multimillionaires move here and buy up our land, using Montana as their personal playground. With so much changing, we’ve got to have somebody in the Senate who’s willing to fight for our Montana way of life. 

        I still farm the land just outside of Big Sandy that my grandparents homesteaded more than 100 years ago. I feel those changes that are going on in Montana right now, every day. 

        Montana needs somebody back in Washington, D.C. who understands rural America. Someone who fights for our freedoms and goes to bat for our veterans, our family farms and ranches, our working families, our health care workers and our teachers. I’m running to keep up the fight for those folks, and to make sure our kids and grandkids can grow up in the same Montana we know and love. Montana is the greatest state in the greatest country in the world and it’s damn sure not for sale.
    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a senator?
      response: |+
        My most important job is listening to the voices of Montanans and bringing their perspectives back with me to Washington. I’ll take on anyone from any party — including Joe Biden — to do what’s right for Montana. 

        There have been times when I’ve worked with him because it helps Montana, like getting my Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill passed to fix roads, bridges, and airports across the state and get internet access into our rural communities. Other times, I’ve stood up to Biden, like demanding he keep Title 42 in place to secure our southern border, and protecting funding for our hunter safety classes after the administration tried to block it. And I worked with Republicans to protect veterans’ Second Amendment rights. My votes are never about toeing the party line — they’re about what’s best for Montana. 

        We live in the greatest state in the greatest country on Earth, and I’ll fight for what’s best for Montana no matter who the president is.
    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        When Donald Trump was president, I worked with him to get things done for Montana and he signed more than 20 of my bills into law to help veterans, crack down on government waste and abuse, and support our first responders. If we’re both elected this November, that’s what I’ll continue to do. 

        I have worked alongside President Trump to pass important legislation like my MISSION Act, which overhauled the VA’s disastrous Choice Program and cut down on bureaucracy so veterans didn’t have to deal with red tape and could get vital care quicker. I was also proud that President Trump signed into law my bills to audit key governmental programs to crack down on fraud and abuse, get critical resources to our rural fire departments across Montana, and protect the East Rosebud river system that south-central Montana knows and loves.

        No matter who sits in the White House, I’ll work with them to deliver for Montana, because we live in the greatest state in the greatest country on Earth.
    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        The deficit is out of control and both parties are to blame. In Montana, we know how to balance a budget and live within our means. That is why I authored a balanced budget proposal. It would protect Social Security and Medicare benefits that our seniors have earned while still forcing the federal government to stop racking up the debt and passing it along to our kids and grandkids. We also need to hold massive corporations accountable and make them pay their fair share.
    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortions or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I do not support a federal ban on abortion.

        Montanans of all stripes don’t want the federal government telling them what to do, and they don’t want politicians or judges stripping away their personal freedoms. Just last year, politicians in Montana ignored the voices of the voters and passed abortion bans. I oppose these bans and will always fight to protect Montana women’s freedom to make their own health care decisions.

        The last time I ran for reelection, Roe v. Wade had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years. Now, those protections are gone — and the attacks on women’s freedoms and privacy are just beginning. I fought in the Senate to pass the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would have enshrined the protections of Roe v. Wade into law. 

        We’re also seeing attacks on basic fertility treatment like IVF across the country, like when an Alabama court ruling forced IVF clinics to cancel their appointments. I will fight tooth and nail to ensure that never happens in Montana.
    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        As a third generation Montanan, I am worried about what is happening to our state. Our local infrastructure is severely strained, and housing costs are skyrocketing. I am deeply concerned about the housing crisis in Montana, which is forcing families to make tough choices about family homes they’ve owned for decades. Out-of-state millionaires are coming here and buying up our land and using Montana as their personal playground. You shouldn’t need to leave your hometown to get a good-paying job, and you shouldn’t need a million bucks to keep a good roof over your head. 

        Montana isn’t for sale. I recently introduced a bill to establish a manufactured housing community improvement grant program, to help revitalize Montana’s affordable housing supply. I will continue pushing for my Rural Housing Service Reform Act to improve federal rural housing programs. We need to continue investing in affordable housing programs. I’ll never stop fighting to protect working Montana families.
    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        There is no question about it, climate change is impacting our economy and our way of life. Sharla and I see these impacts firsthand on our farm, where significant droughts have led to some of the toughest harvests in recent years. 

        We should be developing clean energy technologies to tackle climate change, create good-paying American jobs, and secure our energy independence, and Montana has the opportunity to lead the way. China is actively working to beat America in the clean energy sector in hope of taking over as the world’s strongest economy. We can’t afford to lose this competition. That is why we should invest directly in Montana companies researching next-generation energy technologies that are affordable and lower costs for consumers. Traditional energy sources like oil and gas remain a critical part of how we power our country, so we need to continue to invest in research and development of technologies like carbon capture and storage to reduce carbon emissions.
    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        What’s happening on the southern border is unacceptable. 

        I’ve called on President Biden to step up and do everything in his power to secure the border, and I supported a strong bipartisan deal to get our border under control earlier this year. This bipartisan bill was backed by the National Border Patrol Council and would have hired more border patrol agents, cracked down on the fentanyl crisis, and tightened asylum standards. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues voted to keep the border open for another year so they could campaign on the issue.

        I have been talking with Montanans, sheriffs, and mayors, they all are feeling the consequences of the situation at the southern border, from stretched law enforcement budgets to fentanyl in the communities. I was proud that my bipartisan FEND Off Fentanyl Act passed to place sanctions on countries engaged in international trafficking of illegal fentanyl and give law enforcement the resources they need to battle the fentanyl crisis.
    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        Every Montanan deserves access to affordable and quality health care — especially for folks in rural communities where access to health services can mean the difference between life and death. That is why I have fought in the Senate to address health care worker shortages in rural Montana and secured crucial resources for our rural hospitals and clinics, including better funding for emergency services.

        There are some politicians who want to fully privatize our health care system. I oppose any plan to do so. This would put our rural hospitals and critical programs like Medicare at risk. I will stand tough against any plan to privatize Medicare, because our seniors shouldn't have to forgo health care just because they can’t afford it. I was proud to pass legislation that allowed Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices and capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35/month — and I will fight to ensure that Montana’s nursing homes stay open and fully-staffed.
    - question: Under what if any circumstances do you believe the U.S. should be providing military support to parties involved in foreign conflicts?
      response: |+
        As chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee my top priority is to always keep America safe, and ensure Montana stays the greatest state in the greatest country in the world. Our military priorities should lie in protecting America and our allies, and staying ahead of our adversaries like China and Russia who want to replace us as the world’s leading superpower. I’ll fight tooth and nail to defend America from military, economic, and democratic threats. 

        We should be strategic and only involve America in foreign conflicts when it strengthens our alliances and benefits the United States. The U.S. can’t and shouldn’t get involved in every foreign conflict, but America is safer when we have strong alliances and our allies know they can trust the U.S. to stand by them when facing threats. 

        My top priority will always be defending Montana and our nation, full stop. I’ll continue fighting to forcefully counter foreign adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

        Currently, our open border is our biggest issue. A nation without borders is not a nation. As your congresswoman, I will use the power of the purse to defund our government until our border is shut. I will fight for limited and accountable government, Second Amendment rights and the sanctity of life. I will stand up to the ruling elite who are destroying the American way of life and all that has made our country great by taking away our liberty; by undermining our nation’s elections; and by pushing radical race and gender ideology in our schools, boardrooms and media. I will fight for Montana's water rights and logging rights. I will fight against tax hikes. I will say NO to manipulation used to cause fear, like pandemics and global warming. If we as Americans continue to abandon the principals that have made us the greatest and freest nation in the world and refuse to recognize the internal and external threats, we are sowing seeds of our own destruction.

I would also support logging efforts and competitive industry to drive down the cost of construction materials. 

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?

America should keep working on a lower carbon foot print, improve fuel efficiency, decrease waste and have discussions with world leaders about appropriate population levels.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Yes. We need to reject any tax cuts, including renewal of the big 2017 tax cut for the wealthy, reject arms deliveries to Israel’s right wing government, and reject the proposed $150 billion Nuclear Missile Modernization package, which includes $20 billion to the U.S. Department of Energy for 1,250 new Nuclear arheads for the modernized Sentinel.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        I will try to make federal land close to our communities available for long-term lease at favorable terms to Limited Equity Housing Cooperatives to build sky-scraping carbon-sequestering multi-family structures. Co-operative members with proprietary leases for a dwelling in such structures will be able to enjoy a gain in equity, limited by the increase in the community’s median income for the corresponding period. The Federal Housing and Urban Development program for guaranteeing 90 percent of required long term financing of the multifamily structures will have to be made as robust as is required.

      response: |+
        There is not one specific issue troubling eastern Montana but a kaleidoscope of several issues. It is my observation that the border crisis, agriculture, natural resource development, inflation and home purchase prices share a top priority type of interest with Montana voters. One thing is for sure: In every corner of the district the open border policy of the Democrats seems to irritate people the most. There are thousands of people streaming illegally across the border daily. We are giving these illegal aliens all sorts of free benefits, like free debit cards, cell phones, health care, education and hotel accommodations. Don’t forget that they also get a free ride to their favorite sanctuary city for even more benefits. The border needs to be closed first and then we can negotiate a new immigration policy. Those who have already illegally crossed the border need to be sent back. We cannot afford to take in all these people on the backs of the American taxpayer.

      response: |+
        Let's hope that does not happen. He is totally out of it mentally. At any rate, I respect the position and if he wins, he will certainly deserve my respect as our president. Once the election is over it is time to get to work for the American citizens that elected us. All of our efforts should be focused on America and not so much with bickering between all the members.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I do support former President Trump for president. I am willing to listen to his ideas and give him support to get his time-tested policies passage. I never imagined that he would be able to get so much done as he did the first four years. Inflation was low, interest rates were low, the jobs report always showed good results and the farm bills were always supported by President Trump. I never would have believed that a man from New York City could help and support Montana farmers to the degree that he did. I will give him all the support he needs to get the southern border crisis under control.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        We have about a $35 trillion U.S. debt to service. Congress needs to take the steps now to bring down the debt level. We are broke by any business standards. The U.S. government takes in about $5 trillion a year in tax revenue. At this point the best way to start getting a handle on our spending habits is to stop increasing our spending. No new programs. We can't even afford what we have already committed to in the past. We sure could cut national public radio, endowment for the arts, free cell phones, debit cards, hotel rooms, health care and education to illegal aliens. I don't get any of that stuff free myself, why should an illegal alien get it?

        I have always been endorsed by the Right to Life organization. I will continue to support the efforts to save babies from being killed. In this case the U.S. Supreme Court has spoken, and they say it is a state right issue. So let the states handle it and we should step back and see how it goes for a few years.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Congress can work to support the development of our natural resources industry, which will in turn stimulate the economy with new job growth and consumption of American products. We need to drill and use our own American oil to fuel our economy. Once we begin rebuilding our energy sector then the economy will get much better and the value of our dollar will regain strength and purchasing power. This is how you lift everyone up in a modern economy. A strong economy makes everything more affordable.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        I don't view climate change as an urgent issue. There is no amount of tax dollars you can spend to stop the climate from changing if in fact it is changing. Science now shows that when Al Gore declared that the East Coast was going to be flooded by 2020, it in fact did not happen. The shoreline is exactly where it has always been as confirmed by satellite photos. Pollution that is manmade is something that we can control. Let's make more of an effort to tackle an issue like that and the complications that our city landfills are facing.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?

        To me there is a simple answer. Shut the border down from illegal alien crossings, build the wall, stop paying out all the freebies and send the non-profits home. Gather up as many of these people that illegally crossed the border that we can find and ship them back to where they entered the US. What the Democrats have allowed to happen is a crime against all of us taxpayers and our children that will be paying for this debacle for the rest of their adult lives.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        I never supported Obamacare. The day that bill passed was the day my health insurance premiums began to increase uncontrollably. I was told by the Democrats that I would be able to keep using my doctor and my premiums were not going to increase. They were clearly wrong. My bill from Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield rose from $450 per month to $1,700 just before I canceled the plan. I ended up getting coverage from a unfunded Christian health care cost share policy. It is working and now I understand that the Democrats do not like Christian health care companies. Let's repeal Obamacare and let the free market go out and price the product in a competitive atmosphere.

      response: |+
        AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE
        I strongly support policies that prioritize both affordability and excellence in Montana’s health care system. The worrying closure of nursing homes, rural hospitals and the lack of mental health care access to essential services in underserved areas and to expand Medicare prescription drug coverage right now. These actions are essential to alleviate financial burdens on our elderly and at-risk populations, and on the taxpayers who are footing the bill for expensive and preventable services.

        Furthermore, it is important that we untie the hand of health care providers and finally empower them to make diagnostic decisions with the best interest of their patients, instead of asking them to spend their precious time negotiating with bureaucrats who hold the purse strings. Upholding these principles requires concrete policy initiative at improving access, affordability and quality of care statewide.

    - question: Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?
      response: |+
        Even though he is not a current member of Congress I admire Montana's Mike Mansfield. He was the Senate majority leader who was able work across the aisle with members of the Republican Party. He came from humble beginnings as a worker in the Butte mines to being admired and respected to lead Congress through some very difficult times. He was a quiet leader and left our state legislation with laws and regulations to protect our environment but also an era of economic growth for Montana. 

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?
      response: |+
        I will continue to support the work of President Biden with the bipartisan bill Infrastructure Reduction Act to build the necessary programs of Montana with internet needs of the cities and towns of Montana. I will support the passing of the Farm Bill 2025 and push for more reforms in prescription drug coverage and for improved amendments to Medicare. I plan to work to improve the lives of the people of Montana and to listen and vote those on venues which continues to improve the safety our nations well-being.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?

        I will continue to focus on the issues not the attitudes. His administration has many programs President Trump is very passionate about such as immigration and border policies. I will be able vote on the feasibility of these projects and make sure outcomes and goals are possible. If he is president I will respect his stature as president and work across the aisle for the welfare of our nation and Montana.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        We need to make sure everyone pays there fair share. The ability of corporate taxes and owners have been able to find tax loopholes that have made the federal deficit a problem.

        I recognize the federal deficit continues to grow and the overspending need to stop. Since the Congress is the beginning of the budget I will continually make sure those programs on the docket are reasonable and not part of a pork barrel favoring. 

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        As a degree holder in biology with years of experience in the medical field, my stance on reproductive rights is shaped by both academic and professional knowledge and compassionate humanity. Working in a hospital in the Philippines, I witnessed the  consequences of restrictive abortion laws, where women faced life-threatening situations and the loss of both maternal and fetal lives. 

        It is not the government’s role to pry into our private medical records or to make moral decisions about women’s health care. I firmly believe that women are perfectly capable of making these deeply personal decisions for themselves, and as a candidate for public office, I am committed to opposing legislation that would limit a woman’s right to choose and actively supporting measures that codify this fundamental right once and for all. Everyone deserves the autonomy to make decisions about our own bodies, and it is my pledge to stand firm in ensuring that this right is protected and upheld.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Montana, like many parts of our nation, is facing a housing affordability crisis, leaving far too many families struggling to find safe and affordable housing. This crisis is not only impacting individuals and families but also our communities and economy. Here are some potential approaches that I believe could make a real difference. We need Congress to address investing in housing initiatives, promoting homeownership opportunities, limiting corporate ownership of residential property, addressing zoning and regulatory barriers and supporting sustainable housing solutions. 

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        As a man with the privilege of experience both in the oil fields of Eastern Montana and the lecture halls of medical school, I have developed a strong preference for no-nonsense, scientific, evidence-based decision making. I am committed to preserving our planet for future generations. I advocate for investment in renewable energy to ensure Montana remains at the forefront of innovation. I support incentivizing lower emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices to reduce our carbon footprint.

        I recognize the significance of support to communities reliant on fossil fuels, whose labor has contributed to Montana’s economic strength and made discussions about a clean, sustainable future financially feasible. It is essential to balance environmental conservation with the well-being of communities impacted by these policies, striving for solutions benefiting all parties while addressing the challenges of climate change. 

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        A short-term solution to secure the border is to hire more patrols, increase the amount of immigration judges, and improve the gateway areas at border crossings.

        For some long term solutions to the border is to work with the Organization of American States to use their data in countries to screen immigrants that seek asylum. We need to look at the nations with the most people coming to the border as San Salvador, Venezuela and Cuba and find economic ways to improve their hardships in their nations and try to seek economic help in improving some of the catastrophes they are facing. Also, countries as Cuba or Venezuela, begin to negotiate in lifting embargos for trade. Another avenue to improve with our South American nations is to find amendments in the USMCA trade agreement for a more robust economic venue between Mexico, Canada and the United States. With these types of programs many of those who are leaving their countries may begin to find prosperity without traveling. 

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |2+
        I would support lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 50 to extend health care coverage to a larger portion of the population. The success of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has shown the need. Extending Medicare coverage to individuals aged 50 and above would ensure that more people have access to comprehensive health care services, including preventive care, treatment for chronic conditions, and financial protection from health care costs.

        I would support enabling Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Also, I support  addressing high provider prices in health care. Monopolistic practices can limit competition, drive up costs and reduce patient choice. Streamlining administrative paperwork would not only alleviate the burden on health care providers but also allow them to focus more on patient care and less on administration. By tackling integration, high prescription prices, and administrative inefficiencies, we can make real progress toward a more equitable system.

        The biggest issue facing the Eastern District is also my top priority — passing a family-friendly Farm Bill that works for families which should include Country of Origin Labeling (COOL), right to repair, and fully fund safety net and conservation programs. We are an agricultural state and this district is driven by agriculture. It’s our number one industry, generating over $7 billion in activity last year, and the heartbeat of our rural communities and cities. However, under 6% of Congress works in agriculture, and even fewer work their land. Electing candidates who like to cosplay but don’t understand it and sure as heck haven’t delivered anything meaningful isn’t the answer. Rosendale voted against investments in critical irrigation projects that are essential. That’s not being a representative, that’s self-serving. Sen. Tester needs a partner in the House who understands agriculture and who will work in a bipartisan way to get things done for farmers and ranchers who feed the world.

    - question: Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?
      response: |+
        Sen. Tester. He is one of the few other farmers who understand agriculture in Congress. Tester has delivered for Montana, particularly for agriculture and veterans, regardless of who is in charge. From pushing back and blocking dangerous Paraguay beef imports that hurt Montana ranchers by Biden and passing dozens of bills under Trump to delivering critical investments to rebuild infrastructure and irrigation projects, lowering prescription drug prices, protecting veterans and passing the PACT Act, and expanding broadband, Tester has delivered for us and is honest and someone we can trust. I’ll work cooperatively to deliver results for the Eastern District. I’m not alone in knowing that Rep. Rosendale delivered zilch for working folks and agriculture. We get the same if we don’t make a change. Let’s take Montana back by sending another strong leader for rural Montana and agriculture to Congress.

        The debt increased by a record amount under Trump. Don’t be lied to by my opponents. They only want to steal your Social Security and give it to the Wall Street freeloaders. Solutions are on the table to collect from tax cheats and end giveaways to greedy corporations and billionaires but self-serving politicians work for them. Follow the money and muck the halls. The largest contribution to the historic debt was tax cuts for the rich and Wall Street. The richest nearly doubled their wealth while working people lost nearly as much. First, stop stealing from my pocket and neighbors’ pockets only to give it away to the ultra-wealthy. Second, let the tax cuts that only benefit the rich expire. Third, if billionaires and mega corporations benefit from the financial protections this country provides, pay your darn taxes. It’s unpatriotic to take advantage of our economic and financial system and not give back so we can reinvest in our country, the Americans who built it, and the future.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Affording a decent place to live has become impossible for too many. Montana leads the nation with workers who can no longer afford basic necessities, like covering rent and health care. It wasn’t always that way and doesn’t have to be this way now. People want a fair shake and a hand up, not a handout. Provide tax credits and financial assistance for new construction and renovation, and rental assistance for those who cannot afford to buy a home right now. Congress should crack down on the speculators and monied land grabbers driving prices up by buying up land, farms, ranches and real estate. The only way we can solve our affordability problems facing the middle class and workers is by mucking the halls of this corruption. It starts with a ban on insider stock trading. We aren’t going to get things back on track if we don’t make a change and elect officials who are committed to cleaning up the corruption, not buying a seat to enrich themselves. I’ll work for you in Congress.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Climate change is real. We’ve already warmed an average of two degrees. That impacts our snowpack and water supplies —  essential for both agriculture and the outdoors, our economic engines. Worse, recurring drought, hail, and weather-related disasters for agriculture are becoming too common. This summer's forecast isn’t looking much better. My daughter is one of my heroes for standing up in defending our right to a clean and healthful environment in the Held v Montana youth climate lawsuit they won. After all those kids stood up for our rights and future, we must do our part and that means taking action. I’m running for Congress to carry our values of freedom, clean air and water, open and public lands, the outdoors, family farms and ranchers, and way of life forward. A good first step will be for the Farm Bill to fully fund conservation and climate resilience programs for family farmers and ranchers. Clean energy can unplug us from big utilities and provide energy freedom for all.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        The failure to pass the bipartisan border protection bill, introduced by a Republican, which would have addressed this crisis, for purely political reasons pissed me off so much I filed to run for this seat. We have a bill to protect our border, but self-serving politicians are blocking it in a desperate attempt to score points. Politics at its worst. That’s not good for Montana or America. I’ll do what's right for Montana and America every time because those are my values. Border security and immigration are two issues. I’ll never stop working to protect our borders, but unless your relatives were here before the Mayflower, we were all immigrants at some point. We’re darn lucky our families came here. I support pathways to citizenship, part of the American dream, and develop programs to bolster workforce opportunities to address worker shortages. We also need to address the root causes forcing people to uproot and leave their homes —  political unrest, corruption, violence, crime.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        I’d take it right to the pharmaceutical and health care corporations. We have the highest prices for prescriptions in the world. Taxpayers subsidize much of the development. That ain’t right. It’s price-gouging and Congress needs to do more to stop it by expanding our ability to negotiate for lower prescription prices to benefit all Montanans and Americans. Seniors, veterans, and others in need shouldn’t have to head to Canada for affordable life-saving medications. I would also look for ways to expand options and requirements for states to provide Medicaid to those who don’t receive health care through their employer. Gov. Gianforte just shamelessly kicked over 120,000 Montanans, including children, off of health care. Many have jobs but simply can’t afford other options. It’s not only cruel, but it's just bad business. It hurts employers whose employees lost coverage and, as we know, it will raise health care costs for everyone else — another tax — leading to rural provider closures.

        First of all, politics need to be kept out of the climate change conversation. Without truth and honesty, neither side is going to keep an open mind. An independent organization not being paid by biased money needs to run transparent studies to determine if there is a true heating of the Earth or if this is a normal cycle that the Earth has gone through over the course of thousand of years. One needs to answer truthfully if the climate change conversation is a manufactured topic to gain money for the government.

      response: |+
        The two biggest issues are inflation and illegal immigration. 

        Bidenomics has cost Montana families an average of $26,000 more per household since 2021. Every economist agrees — the inflation is being driven by high energy costs and years of uncontrolled government spending. We need to continue pushing legislation that recall pointless spending, cut taxes and incentivize working instead of handouts. 

        On immigration, I meet with county commissioners, sheriffs and tribal leadership daily. I hear over and over how the border crisis is spilling into our communities, stressing our public resources and filling our jails. One of my early votes in 2023 was for the Secure the Border Act. The House has done their jobs, the Senate has neglected theirs for more than a year by not taking it up. But the easiest solution is for the President to do his job. Biden is derelict in his duty and has ignored the constitutional authority he has to fix the crisis he’s created.

        Well, first I’d show Biden where Montana is on a map because he hasn’t shown up here since he got elected. Then, I’d ask for new leadership in the Departments of Interior and Transportation because both agencies are failing Montanans on every level.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I’ve got a fantastic relationship with President Trump. He knows Montana and the issues we face well. Under Trump our country was thriving economically, and we had confidence in our national security because our allies trusted us and our enemies feared us. Now, we couldn’t be in a more opposite situation with Biden in office. I look forward to working with him to make our country great again. 

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Absolutely. I sit on appropriations and my two priorities were to curve spending and remove the woke out-of-touch agenda that’s costing Americans millions. The 12 individual spending bills the committee sent to the House floor cut spending by double digits across the federal government. We cut some agencies by 40%. But cutting is not enough. We also need to grow our way out of this, and that’s where cutting red tape and regulatory reform come in. I voted for the $600 billion tax cuts package to help small businesses hit by high interest rates, encourage lower income families to get back in the workforce, and provide relief to folks just trying to buy gas, groceries and rent.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I have deep empathy for women who find themselves facing this difficult decision. I have never opposed an outright ban and I vehemently oppose efforts by the Democrats to make abortion legal up to the moment of birth. Abortion should be regulated, safe and legal in the first trimester, but policymakers must recognize that the best way to prevent abortions in the first place is to make sure contraceptives are widely available and affordable. 

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        When looking at the cost of housing in Montana you have to look at the big picture, that’s that under Joe Biden, every single thing is more expensive. It is also much more expensive to buy or build a home. To get home construction costs down the government needs to get inflation down, which means stop spending money we don’t have. Bring the historically high interest rates down. Open up mortgages on trailer homes. I’m also working with a bipartisan group on the Hill to expand low-interest and low-downpayment loans to first responders and K-12 educators so they can afford to live in the communities they serve. The average American is paying a $1,000 more a month for basics since Biden took office. It’s more expensive to power and heat homes because Biden’s war on American energy. We need to continue tax cuts for working families, encourage home ownership and policies that make it easier to attain a title, and give the private sector the space to bring back a competitive market.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        There is no debate the climate is changing; man is an influence. I think where there’s debate on it is what that influence is and what can and should we do about it. My view has always been that promoting clean air and clean water and reducing our dependence on foreign energy is a positive step forward. Nobody produces energy more efficiently or cleaner than right here in the United States. When I was secretary we had the biggest production year on record and it was also the best safety year and we lowered emissions. So, the answer is not to cut domestic energy production, the answer is to allow the private sector to continually innovate to make energy more sustainable and efficient while lowering costs and improving safety.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        I just got back from a visit to the southern border and one thing is for sure — there is no border. There’s checkpoints where illegal migrants go to get a shower, a meal, and a piece of paper telling them to report for a court date in six years. The executive orders Biden signed on day one reversed what we spent four years building under Trump. Biden created this crisis, as a result crime, sex trafficking, drug trafficking and fentanyl overdoses are skyrocketing in Montana. The answer is H.R. 2 —  the Secure the Border Act the House passed more than a year ago and the Senate has let collect dust since. Both the Senate and White House have the tools they need to secure the border —  but it’s going to take a Senate and White House to work with the House to get it done. 
        H.R. 2
        Ends catch and release
        Supports ICE to do their jobs, 
        Resumes construction of the wall,
        Holds Mexico accountable
        Reinstates the successful Remain in Mexico policy

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        The evidence is clear that Obamacare has been a failure for Montanans and health insurance plans continue to get more expensive. History has shown us that the best way to ensure affordable and accessible health care coverage is employer-sponsored coverage. Additionally, the U.S. needs to stop providing coverage to illegal aliens. It’s crushing our hospitals and clinics, stressing systems and all the costs are being pushed down to patients.

    - question: What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        Water is the lifeblood of eastern and central Montana, where rural communities depend upon access to clean drinking water and agriculture producers depend on reliable access to water for their crops. In Congress, I will be a tireless advocate on water-related issues, for irrigation projects that agriculture depends upon and by supporting infrastructure investments in water projects that rural communities need for clean drinking water.

        Public safety is critical to our communities and that is why I strongly disagreed with the $1.2 trillion Biden-Schumer 2024 budget bill that passed and defunded federal law enforcement agencies by $1 billion. That is the type of chaos in Washington, D.C. that will negatively impact Montana communities and we need to crush. Connected to public safety is the need to secure the U.S. southern border — which I personally visited in February — to fight illegal drugs and cartels.

    - question: Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?
      response: |+
        Don Bacon (R-Nebraska). I respect Rep. Bacon because he is a common sense conservative who seems to be in Washington to do the work of the people who sent him, without seeking fanfare or celebrity status, which is the kind of leadership I believe we need more of. 

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Out-of-control deficit spending is a threat to the future of our country. We can get our budget back on track by reforming our legislative processes in a manner that allows for a fiscally conservative approach to financing government programs. Targeting one specific program of the budget for cuts will not achieve overall reduction of our budget.
        First, we need to have single-subject legislation in Congress, rather than large thousand-page, multi-subject omnibus bills. Single-subject legislation allows bills to pass or fail on their own merits.

        Second, we need to get back to regular order —  bills starting in committees, being debated and voted on and then moving to the full house for amendments, votes and compromise, rather than large legislation bypassing normal procedures.

        Finally, we need to get back to asking whether whatever the federal government wants to do is specifically contemplated by the Constitution as being the responsibility of the federal government or not.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        The issue of abortion and medical privacy should be determined by the people of each state, like has been happening through state referendums on the issue, rather than a one-size-fits-all federalized approach.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Solutions to the housing issues are generally best addressed at the state and local level, not in Washington, D.C. However, Congress should investigate and evaluate any federal regulatory barriers discouraging development of additional housing or that may be distorting housing markets and access to affordable financing options for first-time home buyers.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        We have an obligation to be good stewards of the beautiful place we are lucky enough to live in. I do support responsible development of Montana’s natural resources that also complies with the Montana Constitution’s guaranteed right to a “clean and healthful environment.” I do think climate change is happening and that there are areas Congress can work on, such as by providing incentives in the forms of tax credits or grants, for businesses and individuals to adopt more sustainable practices, promote innovative carbon reducing or capturing practices, invest in energy efficiency and reduce waste.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        I’ve been to the chaotic U.S. southern border and have observed this national security threat to Montana and our entire nation personally. I support a bipartisan strategy that provides the resources and personnel needed to secure the border and reduce the chaos. This includes more border patrol agents, immigration officers and judges, together with reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        Americans deserve a health care system that provides high-quality health care that is both accessible and affordable.

        Congress needs to shine a spotlight on all sectors of the health care industry and look for ways to promote transparency for consumers and the public, as the best ways of raising awareness about practices that may not be in consumers interests. Areas Congress should look at in the health care industry includes the influence and power of the pharmaceutical industry on the cost of prescription drugs, as well as the many mergers and consolidations of hospitals. The interests of families, patients and communities must be put first, over shareholder profits and dividends. The health care industry is not a traditional market where there is ample choice for consumers, which means there are dangers for monopolistic and anticompetitive abuses occurring, requiring adequate oversight at the federal and state level.

      response: |+
        Inflation caused by the national debt spending. Every person in Montana is paying more for expensive groceries, high gas prices and living with high inflation. If we do not get the out-of-control spending the future of our country is at risk. Congress must pass a balanced budget provision. Congress must also adopt single issue spending bills and term limits as way to address this issue that we cannot put off any longer.

        Rand Paul. He takes protecting the U.S. Constitution and our freedoms very seriously.

      response: |+
        I would stop members of Congress, and their spouses, from trading stocks while in office. Congress is using this as a way to get rich, it is self-serving and eroding trust in Congress. It must end. 

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        President Trump had previously made competing with China a priority, and I will work with him to continue that work. I passed the bill in Montana to prohibit foreign adversaries, like China, from buying our land. I will pass this bill at the federal level. 

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Yes, of the utmost priority. Congress must first pass a balanced budget provision as a long-term fix. We must also stop sending our money overseas. The alphabet agencies like the FBI, CIA, NSA should all have massive budget cuts. The U.S. military needs to become more cost conscious. Also, we need to be sending our education dollars directly to the states instead of spending so much on federal bureaucracy. There is plenty to cut. 

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I am pro-life. I have voted for all pro-life bills in the Montana Legislature and will do the same in Congress. I also believe in federalism and the states should be determining their laws.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Congress must pass a balanced budget provision. Spending money the government does not have is causing inflation to spiral out of control, making things more expensive for Montanans. A balanced budget provision will stop Congress from continuing unsustainable spending and will lower inflation, making housing more affordable. 

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        It is not an urgent issue. We should stop using tax dollars to subsidize "green" energy implementation but instead let the free market determine the speed at which we adopt new energy technologies. 

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        Congress must secure the border now! This includes closing the gaps in the southern border wall, ending catch and release, bringing back the “remain in Mexico” policy. There should not be any more free flights, debit cards, and New York City hotel rooms for people coming across; it is incentivizing border crossings and must end. Congress must also reform the legal immigration system to a merit-based system that allows people to enter who will assimilate and be an asset to the U.S., not a drain on it.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        The federal government needs to move towards more preventative medicine research instead of a "sick-care" system that is only concerned about healing the current disease. By focusing on disease prevention, it will reduce the amount of time people are in the hospital due to disease. To do this, we must adopt my bill I passed in Montana to expand medical right-to-try, shift NIH funding to age-related disease prevention, and reform the FDA towards innovation and efficacy.

        Protecting democracy and our right to vote our leaders into office. Immediately followed by fair taxation/no inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. In many cases, as an example, corporations are a greater burden on our publicly-funded infrastructure and paying a fair share is the American way. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families and place large corporations in a tax bracket that is more reflective of their heavier use of public infrastructure than the average citizen.

        Jasmine Crockett of Texas. There are very few people in Congress, current and past, that I truly admire, but more and more I’m seeing people my age and younger who are bringing fire to the firefight and making a difference, and Rep. Crockett is a star. Her wit, her cadence, her style and her inability to tolerate fools is something we need. She’s sharp and well-informed, ready and willing to do the work but will call out unacceptable idiocy in open conversation. There are no smoke and mirrors on her watch. I look forward to working with her.

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?
      response: |+
        The American Rescue Plan and the Infrastructure Plan already passed by the Biden administration are good blueprints for what we need to do next. We need to, and President Biden has asked for, an expansion of the child tax credit. We can invest in first-time home buying programs, microgeneration of electricity and regulate fair sale rates back to the grid. We can expand our infrastructure investments to massively expand broadband, high-speed rail, airport, sea ports and shipping infrastructure. We can advance the goals of clean air, clean water, manage wildlife and expand our public lands, and still have businesses making money and growing our economy. We need to remind investors that investing in the tech for wind and solar will pay off both monetarily and socially in the future. And while I agree with many Biden policies, I don’t agree 100% of the time, and I’d work with the administration as much as possible to make sure that where we don’t agree we also do no harm.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I make no bones about the fact that I disagree with Mr. Trump on far more items than I agree with him, but that doesn’t mean it’s 100%, and just like with President Biden, I’d work to make sure that where we disagree we do no harm, and where we agree we work together to improve the lives of all Americans. 

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        I would aim to drive economic growth, create fair taxation and establish fair compensation rules to reduce the federal deficit. We should be investing in education as the fastest way out of the deficit is innovations.

        Fair taxation/No inflation. Corporations and the ultra-wealthy must be required to pay their fair share. Fair tax policy will lift some of the burden on individuals and families. 

        Fair compensation. Over the last five decades the playing field has tilted wildly in favor of the few ultra-wealthy and it’s time to level the playing field. We need to cap executive pay in relation to the pay of frontline workers. And, unions are the fastest way to regular wage increases so get a union.

        Economic growth. Montana is the #1 state for entrepreneurs. We have a long, proud history of being hard workers and smart creators. We have the space to build things, including more housing, and transport things manufactured as we have the routes to distribute them.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I would support federal legislation that guarantees that all women will have access to health care, including abortion, on a national basis. It’s 2024 and I can’t believe we’re having to explain this to a whole national party, but women are human and deserve full human rights.

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Making sure that first-time buyers have access to loans at good interest rates is important, and that we are investing money into growing communities to expand their housing inventory. That also means making sure that the majority of housing is available to homebuyers as opposed to private equity and for investment purposes so we’re reasonably ensuring housing availability for families without being in competition with for-profit operations. The credit score regulations are stacked against people, especially those in their 20s and 30s. We need to adjust the regulations on credit scores so rental history counts towards your ability to qualify for a loan, and not using a credit card has a positive impact on your score rather than impacting your score negatively. 
        Additionally, reducing the wage gap at every business will improve things for everyone, while fighting greedflation and the price gouging that’s currently driving up the costs of living for everyone will help.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Science says we have 10 years. We’ve all watched as winters have gotten warmer and less snow has fallen. In Montana we have the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment. We that enshrined for every U.S. citizen. In Montana we have a deep love for our outdoor heritage. We can take advantage of our healthful environment, by encouraging active family lifestyles via walkable communities, which would also reduce the emissions that threaten the landscapes we love. Public lands are a precious resource as land availability is finite. To maintain open spaces we should encourage the creation of community development with smart density population growth rather than disconnected suburban sprawl. Addressing climate change is also a necessity for the rural livelihood of our farmers and ranchers because sudden and/or extreme weather events caused by climate change can devastate crops and significantly change the care needed (and cost involved) in raising crops to a successful harvest.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        The security needed at our southern border is, in part, a symptom of immigration laws that are too complicated. The immigration system needs to be improved upon significantly and treating people with humanity should not take a backseat to any other interest. Reducing the over-adversarial stance of our immigration policy, combined with funding the research and investigative arms, will mean faster ways for good people to move here, which will ultimately help us grow.

        None of this happens without the funding and authorization to do so, and that comes from Congress getting its act together and actually passing comprehensive border reform. We can do this. It takes time and dedication and elected officials who are interested in finding solutions. It takes someone like me, a fighter who knows when not to fight.
    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        Health literally equates to wealth so the healthier we are as a country, the wealthier we will all be and our overall economy will be stronger as well. Medicare should be expanded to everyone as a public option, and Medicare and Medicaid must be allowed, like all other health care insurers, to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies on the costs of treatments. We’ve seen lives improve when people have access to affordable, quality health care. Healthy people stay healthy because they aren’t afraid a regular check-up is going to bankrupt them. Healthy people with access to preventative care are also able to focus their energy on careers and business ideas, rather than struggling to be well. It’s well past time that we all agree that making sure someone can see a doctor when a little issue arises without fear of losing their jobs or facing bankruptcy, is better than having someone wait till they need to hit the ER for help.

      response: |+
        Federal government overreach, overspending and irresponsibility are destroying the country. The Biden administration has failed to secure our border and is allowing illegal migrants to overrun our nation and threaten our national security. The number of illegal aliens that entered our country under Biden is six times Montana’s population.

        Our national debt is crushing our families and children by exacerbating inflation and making everyday goods inaccessible. The bureaucracy is attacking our way of life with burdensome regulations. As a member of the Land Board, I fiercely protected Montanans personal property and water rights. I promise to reign in the overreaching regulations of the Bureau of Land Management.

        The federal government is out of control and is damaging the American dream for Montanans. We must put America first. That means protecting our borders, supporting Montanan farmers, ranchers, and small business owners, and not saddling our future generations with crushing debt.

    - question: Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?
      response: |+
        I admire Congresswoman Harriet Hageman, who took out RINO Liz Cheney. Congresswoman Hageman isn’t afraid to tackle tough issues and champions issues that are important to Montanans. She wants to return education back to the states by dismantling the Department of Education. The congresswoman supports property and water rights and is fighting to make America energy independent.

        I also admire Congressman Matt Rosendale and many of the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) members who have led the way to get federal spending under control. I am honored to have the endorsement of the HFC chairman, Congressman Bob Good, and other members such as Congressmen Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Mary Miller, Troy Nehls and Josh Brecheen. I also have the endorsements of Montana Freedom Caucus members Sen. John Fuller, Sen. Steve Hinebauch, Sen. Dan Bartel, Rep. Jerry Schillinger and Rep. Bob Phalen. These members endorsed me because I will fight for conservative values, cut spending, and put America first. 

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?
      response: |+
        I would happily work with anyone who wants to put America first, secure our border and prioritize prosperity for our citizens. I also would welcome an invitation to the White House to enlighten Biden on how his reckless policies have hurt Montanans and all Americans. Hopefully, the administration would change its position on the border, the economy, energy and many other policy areas. 

        Biden’s most recent sweeping changes to the Department of Education Title IX rules creates a one-size-fits-all policy that removes any local input into our schools with a radically woke redefinition of sex. This rule threatens women-only spaces and women’s sports. That is why I submitted a public comment opposing this rule when it was first proposed. As superintendent of public instruction, I directed schools to not implement these changes, and I will continue to fight against this destructive change to Title IX with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen.


    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I would work with President Trump to secure our border, return energy independence, unleash economic potential of small businesses and put America First. President Trump is America’s best chance to get back on track to protect the American dream. That is why I was the first in this congressional race to endorse him.

        Together, President Trump and I will work to drain the swamp of the entrenched bureaucrats who unfairly target Montana families, ranchers and farmers. The southern border will be secured to stop the flow of dangerous cartels who poison our communities with fentanyl. Since 2017 there has been an increase of 1,900% in fentanyl deaths in Montana. America will once again be energy independent when Montana leads the way in accessing the abundance of natural resources our country possesses. President Trump and I will unleash the economic potential of Americans, and our global enemies will respect and fear us. Once again, we will have leadership that puts America first.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        America’s debt problem is the biggest threat facing our nation. The government has a spending problem, not a taxing problem. Our debt is currently over $34 trillion dollars, that is more than $103,000 for every citizen. U.S. interest payments will hit $870 billion this year — that is more than America spends on defense. Congress cannot tax their way out of this problem. I will never vote to increase taxes on the hardworking families of Montana.

        Congress must focus on cutting the wasteful spending of the bureaucracy. I have a record of cutting spending at the Office of Public Instruction, and Montana voters know that I will bring that fiscal responsibility to the D.C. swamp. Congress can cut the Department of Education, the IRS, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the EPA, which has been weaponized against Montana farmers and ranchers. There are many opportunities to cut spending across all the agencies, and I am ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work for Montanans.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I believe that every life is precious. I will always protect the lives of those who cannot advocate for themselves, the unborn. The Dobbs v. Jackson decision from the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade and returned abortion policy back to the states. This decision established that states have the authority to enact restrictions on abortions. Federally, Congress can ensure that tax dollars are not used for abortions by prohibiting funding from going to national and international organizations whose main purpose is promoting and performing abortions. 

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        Much of the housing crisis here is due to misguided policies from the federal government and state regulations. Inflation, mainly caused by out-of-control federal spending and rising energy costs, make it harder to build and maintain housing.
        Congress must cut regulations that hurt Montana small businesses, our farmers and ranchers, and our ability to build affordable homes. The bureaucracy in D.C knows nothing of the struggles our communities face, instead they restrict the innovation that made America great.

        High energy costs burden our businesses and farmers which in turn increases the cost of all necessary goods for Americans. One of the first legislative initiates I would pursue is unleashing American energy potential. Here in Montana, we can lead the way. Congress needs to expand an “all of the above” energy production policy that allows natural gas and oil producers to access and provide these abundant resources to Americans.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Far too often the government bureaucracy gives into climate alarmists who present a false choice between a strong economy and a clean environment. In reality, America’s free market has allowed innovation that has made us a leader among nations. Shutting down energy production, like climate activists want, will only hurt American industry and ingenuity. Free market consumer choices should lead rather than the heavy hand of the government. Between the cold weather and long distances in Montana, electric vehicle mandates are not feasible or realistic. Mandating electric vehicles, as the Biden administration has done, will cripple our farmers and fundamentally hurt our ability to grow and transport food.

        Rogue nations like China are the true polluters of this world. Yet America buys critical minerals from China instead of accessing the abundance of U.S. resources. America will create jobs through the responsible development of resources, spur innovation, and not use child labor. 

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        Quite frankly, improving our national security along the border and reforming our immigration system is the top priority for Montana and America. Since Joe Biden took office there have been over 7.2 million illegals who invaded the U.S. through our southern border. That number is greater than the population of 36 states. First and foremost, Congress must secure the border by finishing the wall and implementing technologies that will assist our Border Patrol agents. Congress must reauthorize the Remain in Mexico policy put in place by President Trump and end “catch and release.” The backlog in the immigration courts must be addressed so that a free pass isn’t given to criminals, terrorists and drug dealers. Finally, America must deport illegal migrants who have flagrantly broken U.S. law, by dealing drugs, stealing property and assaulting and murdering U.S. citizens.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        The government needs to reign in the regulations and strengthen the freedom to choose what health insurance they want. Congress must enact legislation that treats employees the same way as employers. Workers should be able to purchase their own plan with pre-tax dollars and take it with them from job to job. This would be especially beneficial for those later in life when health problems often materialize.

        Obamacare’s top-down, one-size-fits-all strategy increased costs, decreased quality and consolidated the health care market, reducing competition and choice for patients. Montanans must be empowered to take control of their health care decisions and allowed to purchase the insurance they want, not the insurance the government dictates to them. Congress must promote transparency in health care price and quality, so families are not surprised by bills. I will work to improve health care access for our rural and aging communities in Montana who are often ignored by D.C. special interests.

    - question: What do you regard as the biggest issue Montana is facing that Congress is in a position to address? How would you address it if elected or re-elected?
      response: |+
        Housing. Having traveled tens of thousands of miles in my minivan connecting with people, the issue people everywhere want solved is housing. Students are worried about the high cost of rent, homeowners are worried about rising property taxes and seniors are increasingly unable to find space in nursing homes.

        I’ve held workshops on housing across the district. Our communities have thoughtful, innovative ideas to address housing, but they need support from federal partners.

        Congress can impact housing policy through policies such as: changes in the tax code; removing the permanent chassis requirement for manufactured homes; offering incentives that promote housing construction in high-demand regions; aligning policies that affect transportation, water, and sewer with housing production; and redefining “affordable” so middle class families have access to programs that can help them afford to buy or rent a home. Sen. Tester has proposed solutions that I would advance in the House.

    - question: Can you name a current member of Congress you admire? What do respect about them?
      response: |+
        Jon Tester. Sen. Tester has been an effective legislator for Montana, and instrumental in investing in Montana through projects like the Tech Hub designation that led to growth of a local optics and photonics industry bringing good jobs to Montana; Kagy Boulevard in Bozeman, the PACT Act for veterans that helps people here get care they need, and the 93 bypass in Kalispell. Sen. Tester has pushed for enactment of legislation like the Blackfoot Clearwater Stewardship Act and the Montana Headwaters Legacy Act, advancing homegrown solutions to help local issues on the ground. 

        I will be a partner in the House to help get these kinds of bills across the finish line.

    - question: If President Joe Biden is re-elected, how would you want to work with his administration as a congressman?
      response: |+
        My first priority is always to do right by Montana. I will work respectfully with everyone, regardless of party, to make sure that the necessary work gets done, but I will also take on anyone whose actions hurt Montanans. I will work with the administration to get inflation under control and increase the supply of housing that people can afford in our state. Housing costs are a growing concern across the country, and I will work with anyone to champion this issue and make housing more affordable.

        I will work with the administration to defend our privacy and freedom, and will work to protect the right for all women to choose when and how they start their family.

    - question: Similarly, if former President Donald Trump is elected, how would you want to work with him?
      response: |+
        I have spent my career working to bring people together to tackle hard problems. I will take that same approach to D.C. and work with whoever is in office to fight for Montanans. I will work respectfully with everyone, regardless of party, to make sure that the necessary work gets done, but I will also take on anyone whose actions hurt Montanans.

    - question: Do you regard reining in the federal deficit as a priority? If so, in what budget areas would you support spending cuts or tax increases?
      response: |+
        Yes. A first step is making sure that those who have benefited the most from the American economy pay some taxes — the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthiest and biggest multinational corporations should be allowed to expire. That alone will go a long way to reining in the deficit. We must also surgically cut government waste where it exists while ensuring we take care of our veterans, children, the elderly, and invest in our future.

    - question: Would you support federal legislation that either restricts abortion access or guarantees access on a national basis? With what conditions?
      response: |+
        I stand by the privacy and freedom that we are guaranteed as Americans to make the most personal decisions about our lives without government interference, and support legislation that protects that constitutional privacy and freedom. As the mother of three daughters, I trust women and their families to make the most private decisions in their lives — including when, whether and with whom to become a parent. In Congress I will fight to protect Montanans' freedoms, including the right to make private decisions about abortion and IVF fertility treatments, so families in Montana have the freedom to decide when and how they choose to start their families, without government mandates and intrusion. I will support legislation that restores the freedoms protected by Roe v. Wade. 

        I will never let the government interfere with our most basic, fundamental freedom to make the private decisions about who we love, whether we have a family, and how we live. 

    - question: What if anything should Congress do to ensure Montanans have access to affordable housing?
      response: |+
        It’s simply unacceptable that school teachers, saw mill workers, nurses and lifelong Montanans can’t afford a home, as more and more Montanans are being squeezed out. 

        Solving the housing crisis requires all elected representatives to engage together. Congress can support: use of mass timber; addressing restrictions to unlock supply of manufactured homes; adjusting cost of living and Area Median Income to reflect local realities; increasing trade school programs to bring more local workers into the industry; more directly funding local government through programs grants; raising the threshold on qualified census tract criteria for LIHTC and expand the program to include higher wage earners to target key employees like teachers, police, fire, nurses; removing incentives to own multiple homes, such as removing tax deductibility of second homes and taxing corporate ownership of multiple housing stock; and supporting legislation that Sen. Tester is working on, including the PRICE act.

    - question: To what extent do you see climate change as an urgent issue? What if any action should Congress take to address it?
      response: |+
        Drought, increased wildfire, and decreased snowpack are urgent issues we must address now. The energy transition is here, and Montana can be a leader in investing in Montana while taking advantage of our incredible resources and growing our economy. We can streamline the transmission process, consider all options for energy that have zero carbon emissions, and develop distributed generation to ensure energy resilience, freedom, and security in our communities that will define our economy in the next 20 years. Western Montana has the resources and infrastructure to lead this economic growth. 

        My experience working in the energy world, working on projects from soup to nuts, representing landowners, project developers, off takers and advocating for farmers, ranchers, energy producers and everyday Montanans makes me a powerful voice for Montana in Congress. We can secure a livable future for all by investing in the energy transition and making sure Montana’s resources benefit Montanans.

    - question: What if any action should Congress take to change how the nation controls movement across the U.S.-Mexico border?
      response: |+
        Secure the border and make sure there is a legal process for immigration that works. The Bipartisan Border Security bill in the Senate was a real step forward that would allow us to immediately shut down the border if it becomes overwhelmed, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, and crack down on the flow of fentanyl. The bill was endorsed by the men and women in the Border Patrol on the front lines. In Congress, I will work to secure our border and protect Montanans. I will never play politics with our safety.

    - question: The cost of health care is a concern for many Montanans. What if any federal action would you support to improve the U.S. health care system?
      response: |+
        I will support legislation to protect Montanans access to care and make sure they can afford it. Some steps I would take include making sure the 2008 Mental Health Parity Act is fully funded and followed, ensuring that Medicaid expansion remains intact, addressing the costs of prescription drugs as was done with the legislation that implemented $35 insulin, protecting veterans by supporting legislation like the PACT Act, listening to our Native Americans and acting to make sure they get health care in the communities they live in; addressing costs of transport for health care and making sure they are covered when necessary; making sure nursing home costs are covered so our nursing homes remain open.

        Rural hospitals in our state also depend on Medicaid expansion and maintaining the program is crucial to ensuring our hospitals can keep their doors open. I will fight to protect Medicare and the expansion of Medicaid to ensure our Montana communities are safe and stable.

    - question: Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services but are calculated through a system set at the state level. What if any changes to the state tax system would you support?
      response: |+
        All of us conservative Republicans tried fixing this in the 2023 session. The entire tax appraisal formula needs to be based off of acquisition value not fair market value. What you paid for your house is what you are taxed on. As governor I intend to return to mining, logging and responsibly utilizing our natural resources. The property tax problem is because the tax burden has shifted to residential property owners where as 30 years ago proceeds from natural resource taxes is what funded local government. 

    - question: Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?
      response: |+
        The school finance system of ANB funding is fine. It's not a funding issue. Private schools educate their students with less money and students generally have better outcomes. The public schools need to return to the three R's of education. Private schools and home schools are taking children out of the public school because the parents don't want their children indoctrinated. They went woke and they're going broke. Many public schools are top-heavy with administration and those funds should go to the teachers. Many schools also went fully computerized with Google classroom and the cyber and ransom insurance for these platforms is extremely expensive. These schools could buy text books and pay their teachers much higher salaries. 

    - question: Montana maintains largely unencumbered legal access to abortion as a result of the state Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Montana Constitution’s right of privacy, even as other states restrict when and how patients can terminate their pregnancies. What are your priorities regarding abortion access?
      response: |+
        I believe life begins at conception and ends at natural death. If the Legislature brought me that bill I would sign it. Every life matters and unborn babies have the right to live. As a husband, father and man I need to protect those that can't protect themselves. 

    - question: Montana is one of the states that expanded Medicaid access under the federal Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to previously uninsured populations. As governor, would you sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form in 2025?
      response: |+
        I would have to see what bill comes out of the 2025 Legislature. We need to provide some assistance for the health care of children and those folks in need of temporary coverage. I also believe people who can work need to work and provide for themselves, including their health insurance. There needs to be sideboards and curbs on Medicaid or it will become financially unsustainable like every governmental assistance program. Those of us in the private sector don't work seven days a week so everyone can have freebies. 

    - question: Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?
      response: |2+
        This is what happens when you vote for Democrats and regulate fossil fuels out of business. Housing prices are based off of energy production. Higher inputs for developers and builders equals higher outputs to consumers. As governor I would advance the cause of Montana becoming energy independent. I will insulate Montana from the bad policies coming out of Washington D.C. The state of Montana shouldn't be picking winners and losers with regards to who gets housing assistance. The folks getting the assistance are doing so at the detriment of another. I would support the use of tax abatements to allow the private sector to start building again. What's missing in the rental/housing discussion is ‘Why are people short of money?’ Tax proceeds from recreational cannabis will be $100 million in 2024. That revenue is 20% of the $500 million spent on pot? $500 million "reported" in this cash business..... really $600 million, $1 billion? Our entire state annual budget is $7 billion.

    - question: What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?
      response: |+
        Faith SHOULD pay a paramount role in Montana life....unfortunately it doesn't. As a legislator and as governor we can't constitutionally mandate people to have religion in their lives. It is the role of missionaries and churches to spread the word. As governor I would advocate for and educate the people on living by the "Golden Rule" and be kind to one another. Treating others the way you want to be treated resonates with all ages and genres.

      response: |+
        Montanabudget.org has a clear explanation of this in their "The Great Tax Shift" article. Eventually we should eliminate taxes wherever possible, but in the short term we should undo the shift from commercial to residential taxpayers that hurts Montana families to benefit big businesses. The Legislature has to do this — the governor's office doesn't have the authority.

    - question: Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education?

      response: |+
        A nominal 3% increase per year is silly. Inflation is not fixed at 3%. If they want to reduce education spending, the Legislature should be honest and actually do it. If they want to keep pace with inflation, they should do that. The half-measure increase is nonsensical. 

        Regardless of funding, I'd like to see more decisions made by teachers and parents and fewer by one-size-fits-all decisions made in Helena and D.C.

      response: |+
        Medicaid expansion requires more government spending, which requires taxes, and we should reduce taxes. All government spending on health care distorts the market for health care. But cutting Medicaid in a vacuum does nothing to restore market efficiencies to health care, and I wouldn't waste a veto on such a bill, if it came across my desk.

    - question: Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?

        The Legislature should immediately reduce residential property owners' bills and restore the historical balance between commercial and residential property taxes. Going forward the Legislature should reduce and eliminate taxes wherever possible. 

        The DLI's building codes program should eliminate restrictions which increase construction costs, allowing increased housing supply at lower prices for homeowners and renters.

        The state government does not control local zoning, which should be left to cities and counties. 

    - question: What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?

        Gianforte cut his home’s property taxes and raised your property taxes. Gianforte had a $2.5 billion budget surplus, courtesy of the federal government, and still raised state property taxes on Montana homeowners by $250 million a year. And he cut taxes for big corporations and utilities. I will fight for tax fairness for Montana homeowners so they don’t shoulder burdensome and increasing property taxes while big corporations and utilities get property tax cuts. That’s not fair. Montanans are struggling to find places where they can live and work and these Republican property tax hikes are only making things worse.

      response: |+
        Yes, I believe changes are needed. I was involved in the school funding litigation in the late 80s and early 90s. Changes were made after the courts ruled changes were necessary to make funding equitable. I support a system that ensures equally funding for all school systems. Wealthier communities should not have better resourced schools than poorer communities. When this happens, it contributes to unequal educational opportunity and economic disparity. I would eliminate tax credits for private school tuition.

    - question: Montana maintains largely unencumbered legal access to abortion as a result of the state Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Montana Constitution’s right of privacy, even as other states restrict when and how patients can terminate their pregnancies.

      response: |+
        I am 110% for individual freedom and private medical decisions. Gianforte wants to take away Montanans’ freedoms by telling women how to manage their private health care decisions. These decisions are deeply personal and private. The government, and Gianforte, shouldn’t get between a Montanan and their private health care providers. It’s simple. Keep the government out of our private health care decisions. Period. I will not let the GOP and Gianforte take away our freedoms and trample on our private decisions.

      response: |+
        Absolutely. As governor, I would sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form. Studies are clear: Early childhood intervention is critical to protect Montana's most valuable natural resource. Good medical care is critical to successful early childhood intervention and development. For adults, good medical care means more productive workers and a healthier population. Instead of proper health care, the GOP wants Montanans to get our primary care in hospital emergency rooms. Emergency room care costs more and provides less. This results in higher medical costs for all Montanans and poorer health for many Montanans.

    - question: Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?

        Rather than cutting taxes for the rich, give tax incentives to landlords who provide low income housing. Give tax incentives to first time home buyers and homebuilders for houses valued below a level determined by the geographical area. Montana needs affordable housing. We don’t have enough affordable housing stock and out-of-state buyers are moving in and pushing up home prices that are beyond the means of many working Montanans. We need to create incentives for builders to build affordable housing to ensure that working Montanans can afford to live, work and raise a family in the Big Sky State.

    - question: What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?

I believe faith is private to each person and provides a framework for how each of us approaches our family, neighbors, community and society. Each person should be able to live their faith as they choose without government interference.

      response: |+
        Montanans’ concerns over Greg Gianforte’s reckless, record property tax hike on Montana homeowners is the biggest and loudest concern I hear on the campaign trail. I hear it from lifelong Republicans, even elected Republican leaders, who wonder why their wealthy governor, and his supermajority in the Montana Legislature, raised taxes on them while giving tax breaks to corporations. Gianforte also gave tax breaks to himself while increasing taxes on his neighbors! As governor, I will demand the Legislature adjust the property tax rate when home values increase to prevent the burden falling on homeowners, as previous Republican and Democratic governors have done. I also support the wealthy and corporations paying their fair share. Billionaires and millionaires who buy up third or fourth homes here should be on the hook for ensuring that our community heroes — law enforcement officers, teachers and nurses — have an opportunity to live in safe, affordable homes in the communities they serve.

        Our Constitution guarantees “equality of educational opportunity” to every Montanan, and this isn’t up for debate. That means whenever schools in our state face shortfalls, we have a constitutional obligation to roll up our sleeves and find funding, without unfairly heaping the burden solely onto ordinary homeowners, and without creating chaos and uncertainty for counties, as Gov. Gianforte has recklessly done. I strongly support adequately funding all public schools in Montana with a tax system that doesn’t let the wealthy off the hook while ordinary homeowners get Gianforte’s additional tax bills. As governor, I would also never falsely blame higher property taxes on county commissioners or municipal leaders, as Gov. Gianforte has done. And unlike Gov. Gianforte, I also strongly oppose any effort to fund private or religious schools with public tax revenue.

        I strongly support a woman’s constitutional right to make whatever health care decisions are best for her health and her family and her future, including whether or when to have a family, without interference from any government or politician. I support a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion, which is guaranteed in our Constitution as a matter of privacy. I support strengthening those rights and freedoms. Greg Gianforte, and a handful of extremists in the Montana Legislature, are dangerously hell-bent on taking those rights and freedoms away.

        Yes. Folding more Montanans into Medicaid coverage was a bipartisan solution that has only improved the lives and livelihood of countless people. It has provided certainty and stability in our communities — for kids, seniors and Indigenous people. And it has saved all of us money in the long term. When asked about the 133,000 Montanans who lost Medicaid coverage under Gianforte’s watch, including 36,000 children, he responded that his plan for stripping health care was “working as intended.” That kind of approach is dangerous, cruel, costly and immoral.

      response: |+
        Montana faces a housing crisis that Greg Gianforte has overseen, while making our state the most expensive it’s ever been. And only someone as wealthy as him would have the gall to call his own crisis “The Montana Miracle.” The first thing I’ll do as governor is to stop making the problem worse — as Gov. Gianforte has done. Look, he raised property taxes on ordinary homeowners (while cutting his own taxes) and proclaimed “Montana is a great place to sell” without doing the hard work of making our state more affordable and more livable (he has certainly not looked out for public schools, law enforcement agencies or hospitals). We must ensure that our community heroes — law enforcement officers, teachers and nurses — have an opportunity to live in safe, affordable homes in the communities they serve, and we can do that by reexamining our tax system to make sure that billionaires and millionaires (like Gianforte) who drive up home prices here are on the hook for their fair share.

    - question: What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?
      response: |+
        While I deeply respect the First Amendment right for all people to practice whatever faith they choose, I also believe in the First Amendment guarantee that our government respects no establishment of religion. To that end, I have significant concerns about Greg Gianforte’s efforts to fund private religious schools with public tax dollars. As governor, he wants to impose his extreme religious views on the rest of us, and I’ll fight his betrayal of our First Amendment rights at every turn.

    - question: Many Montanans are concerned about rising residential property taxes, which primarily fund local government services but are calculated through a system set at the state level. What if any changes to the state tax system would you support?
      response: |+
        As I’ve said and as Montanans know all too well, property taxes are too high and need to be reined in. Last year, we delivered Montana homeowners property tax rebates of up to $1,350 and permanent reforms, saving them over $120 million. Taken together, these measures completely offset the property tax increase of the average Montana homeowner. 

        I’m committed to delivering long-term solutions to rising property taxes. With about 85% of property taxes being collected and spent at the local level, I support reining in out-of-control county spending. We tried to do just that in the 2023 legislative session with SB 511, but special interest lobbyists killed the bill. Just like hardworking Montanans, government at all levels, including local government, should live within its means.

        I also support providing Montana homeowners with a homestead exemption, ensuring out-of-staters, who own second homes in Montana, pay their fair share for our law enforcement, schools, and roads and bridges.

    - question: Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as governor?
      response: |+
        My priority is to support teachers, empower parents, and deliver the best education possible for our kids so they can reach their full potential.

        Last year, we provided record funding for our K-12 public education system. I also stood with our public schools and students when some counties refused to collect the full 95 public school mills. The state collects those mills and fully returns them to school districts to ensure each Montana student has access to a quality education, as the law and our Constitution require. The mills better ensure that students have access to a quality education, regardless of whether they live in lower-resourced school districts or better-resourced ones, like Big Sky. My opponent has criticized collecting the 95 mills, which would have cut public school funding.

        I am also proud to have proposed the TEACH Act, and signed it into law in 2021. The TEACH Act provides millions of dollars in incentives to local school districts to raise starting teacher pay.

    - question: Montana maintains largely unencumbered legal access to abortion as a result of the state Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Montana Constitution’s right of privacy, even as other states restrict when and how patients can terminate their pregnancies. What are your priorities regarding abortion access?
      response: |+
        All life is precious and must be protected. We’ve made progress to protect life —  protecting a child born alive as a result of botched abortion, requiring a doctor to provide a woman with the option to see an ultrasound, safeguarding parental consultation when a 16-year-old girl seeks an abortion, and eliminating taxpayer-funded abortion. Voters know where I stand, but my opponent refuses to say where he stands, including whether he thinks on-demand abortion should be available all the way up to the ninth month.

        The reality is Montana is unique. The Montana Supreme Court in 1999 interpreted our Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion.

        Abortion is a heart-wrenching decision facing pregnant mothers. As we work to protect as many unborn lives as possible, we must also have compassion for these women. We must love them both —  mother and unborn child. We must also expand upon our successful work to encourage adoption, so that more children can find loving, healthy homes.

    - question: Montana is one of the states that expanded Medicaid access under the federal Affordable Care Act, bringing health coverage to previously uninsured populations. As governor, would you sign a bill reauthorizing Montana’s expanded Medicaid program in its current form in 2025?
      response: |+
        The safety net of Medicaid should be there for those who truly need it, but it will collapse if all are allowed to climb on it.

        During the pandemic, the federal government didn’t allow states to verify eligibility for Medicaid, and Medicaid enrollment spiked. Last year, the federal government required states to begin verifying eligibility again. Since then, we’ve ensured only those who are eligible can participate, and enrollment is back down to pre-pandemic levels.

        Medicaid should be a temporary program for most people to help them get back on their feet. We should encourage work and reduce government dependency by requiring able-bodied adults with no dependents, excluding seniors and single parents, to work to receive benefits.

    - question: Housing costs are a concern for many Montanans. What should state government do to push rents and home prices toward levels that are reasonably affordable for middle- and low-income residents?
      response: |+
        Joe Biden’s inflation is making it harder for Montanans to make ends meet. Our housing problem has existed, but was ignored, since 2010, as our population grew faster than housing supply.

        In the last few years, we’ve made progress to solve this crisis. Because government can’t spend its way out of the housing crisis, we’ve emphasized reforms to increase housing supply while protecting our way of life from sprawl.

        Working with legislators and the bipartisan Housing Task Force I launched, we made Montana a national leader, delivering historic pro-housing reforms that will boost supply and make housing more affordable and attainable. Our reforms make it faster, easier and cheaper to build homes. We created incentives for communities to build more densely. We’ve allowed ADUs, apartments in commercial areas and increased access to starter homes.

        The results won’t come overnight, but I’m proud of what we’ve done and remain focused on continuing to build on our pro-housing reforms.

    - question: What role do you think faith should play in Montana’s public life?
      response: |+
        My faith is a guiding light and deeply personal. Just as faith guides many Montanans, my faith has positively influenced my life.

        Government alone can’t provide the full services and support to the people it serves. A central part of our Montana way of life is neighbors help neighbors. Our nonprofit organizations and places of worship also support and serve others. For example, about one in four individuals who seek help for mental health turn to faith leaders before they seek clinical professionals.

        In 2022, our Department of Public Health and Human Services launched the Office of Faith and Community Based Services to strengthen partnerships with organizations that play a fundamental role in supporting health and wellness, as well as self-reliant individuals. By working with these organizations we’re expanding resources and strategies to improve health outcomes for all Montanans.

        We’ll continue to emphasize partnerships between the state and organizations that support Montanans.

      response: |+
        Montana is the gold standard for elections in many ways because we recognize there is always room for improvement. I'll continue to advocate for changes to make our elections more secure, protected from foreign actors and easily accessible. I will also advocate for common sense voter identification requirements.

      response: |+
        As the secretary of state, I'm piloting programs for the nation to massively improve voter roll accuracy which bolters voter confidence. I am so proud of the county and state partnership and team invigorated by my administration. Montana's elections officials are united now more than ever, and this unity is non-partisan success. 

    - question: What if any changes would you like to see made to the business licensing processes overseen by the secretary of state?

        During my time as secretary of state, Montana has become the model for serving the business community, by reducing red tape, cutting and eliminating fees, implementing efficiencies and providing exceptional customer service, where Montanans can start a business anywhere at anytime in record speed. I will continue to apply this approach in my second term.

        Avoid unnecessary partisan conflicts of interest. The current secretary of state needlessly politicizes the office by interjecting herself into party policy projects and advocating for the wants of the governor and attorney general rather than working as an independently elected executive. I will provide accurate information to the county elections officials and the public as required under the constitutional duties of the office.

    - question: What if any changes would you like to see made to the business licensing processes overseen by the secretary of state?

        While the state website received a facelift, its functionality did not improve. In fact, it degraded as the secretary of state prioritized aesthetics over function. Montana's business community deserves a state website without dead links and has undergone a high degree of user engineering. The current offerings of the secretary of state place a large workload on Montana's businesses rather than providing a higher degree of customer service. This disadvantages Montana's small business community, the backbone of our small town Main Streets.

    - question: The attorney general is Montana’s chief law enforcement officer. What do you see as the state’s top law enforcement issue?
      response: |+
        My top priority is the safety of our communities. We've strengthened our laws and directed more resources to those fighting on the front line. 100% of the illicit fentanyl and methamphetamine coming to Montana is manufactured by Mexican cartels and coming across the southern border. This is why I've taken aggressive and proactive legal action against the Biden policies that have left our border unprotected. Locally, we’ve dedicated more resources than ever before to local and state law enforcement, including more narcotics agents, increased participation and leadership in drug task forces, and securing 24 drug detecting K9s for agencies across the state. It's working — more than a half-million dosage units of fentanyl were taken off our streets just last year. I will continue to support law enforcement in the fight to disrupt trafficking networks, keep illegal drugs out of our communities, and aggressively target cartel affiliates and drug dealers who bring this poison into Montana


    - question: Montana attorneys general have historically worked with attorneys general from other states to advance multi-state litigation against parties such as federal officials, pharmaceutical companies and social media companies. What if any national issues would you focus the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources on?
      response: |+
        I’ve joined with my colleagues from around the country in filing more than 40 lawsuits against the federal government relating to the border, gun rights, energy development, economic policies and more. The Biden administration has abdicated its duty to secure the border, allowing drugs to pour into our country, making the fight against crime in Montana more difficult. A state like Montana can’t afford to have an attorney general who will let the federal government run roughshod over our rights.

        I’ve worked with other state AGs — and our own — to hold opioid manufacturers and companies in the prescription opioid distribution network accountable for their roles in the opioid epidemic, securing tens of millions of dollars for state and local governments to use for evidence-based prevention, treatment and recovery initiatives. 

        I’ll continue to aggressively defend Montanans’ rights and our state’s interests during my second term as attorney general.

    - question: The attorney general has the job of defending against lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of laws passed by the state Legislature, which leaders from both major parties say will likely remain in Republican control following this year’s election cycle. How do you see yourself working with legislators as elements of the agenda they pass face judicial review?
      response: |+
        Defending state laws has become an increasingly large part of the litigation work the Department of Justice undertakes as special interest groups seek to overturn the laws duly passed by the state Legislature. The attorney general’s job is to enforce and defend the laws of our state —  period. If someone won’t commit to doing the job, they shouldn’t be running for the position.

    - question: The attorney general is Montana’s chief law enforcement officer. What do you see as the state’s top law enforcement issue?
      response: |+
        Crime is up in Montana, primarily because of the drug crisis. Meth and fentanyl are doing terrible things to our communities.

        As crime increases, Montana Department of Justice needs to provide more support to local prosecutors and law enforcement. The attorney general must also coordinate with federal and tribal law enforcement officers to combat drug traffickers.

        What we are doing today is not good enough. The State is not stepping up to provide help where it is needed most. For example, Lake County does not have the resources to prosecute felonies on the Flathead Reservation and there are around 2,000 outstanding warrants. The attorney general needs to spend more time fighting crime and less time on politics. 


    - question: Montana attorneys general have historically worked with attorneys general from other states to advance multi-state litigation against parties such as federal officials, pharmaceutical companies and social media companies. What if any national issues would you focus the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources on?
      response: |+
        I want to focus on what is happening inside Montana rather than national issues. My job is to represent the people of the state of Montana, not any national interests, and that is what I intend to do. 

        The instances when the Montana attorney general should participate in a national lawsuit are limited. The tobacco litigation and opioid cases are good examples — the attorney general had to participate in those cases to recover funds. If a similar case arises, then I will participate.

        However, the Montana Department of Justice’s litigation resources will be focused on our state. We have a drug crisis, human trafficking is on the rise, and bad actors are engaging in unfair trade practices inside Montana that target senior citizens and consumers. Those issues need to be addressed first.

      response: |2+
        As attorney general of the state of Montana, my job will be to set aside politics and make decisions based on the facts and the law. Regardless of their political party, I will work with every Montana state legislator in good faith and in accordance with the Montana Constitution. I am not a career politician, an activist or an extremist. I am a highly-qualified, experienced attorney who wants to serve the best interests of all Montanans and get things done.

    - question: What do you regard as the most pressing issue facing Montana’s education system?
      response: |+
        I am running to get education back to basics, put parents and students first, and keep our schools safe. These are the most pressing issues before our education system. If you look at our state report card, less than half of students are proficient in reading, writing, and math, yet we spend a record of $13,000+ per student per year. As state superintendent, I will prioritize academic outcomes in core subjects for students and expand career and technical education. I will support professional development for educators, improve customer service from OPI, reduce state administrative burdens on schools, and remain accountable when schools fall short. By focusing our resources on student learning, we can get more funding directly to the classroom and families where it belongs and, in turn, improve student outcomes. Additionally, safe schools and parent engagement are critical to student success. 

    - question: Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?
      response: |+
        Montana’s school funding formula has not been critically studied in a decade. Next year, state education leaders and legislators will begin a new study of the school funding formula. As state superintendent, I plan to play a substantial role in examining what is working and what is not working in how we fund education. We must ensure that school funding directly supports students and makes its way to classrooms while minimizing administrative costs. This will allow education dollars to stretch further and put the focus where it should be: educating students.

    - question: Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?
      response: |+
        As a teacher and school administrator, I know how vital family engagement and respect for family values are to student success. I have collaborated with families for my entire career. By focusing on the fundamental building blocks in education and personalized learning opportunities, we can keep political ideologies out of the classroom. Schools should be environments for learning, not indoctrination. As state superintendent, I will support parental rights while allowing our teachers to focus on teaching their students. That is how I have run my schools and will lead the OPI. 

    - question: The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?
      response: |+
        As state superintendent, I will closely work with colleagues in the Legislature, executive branch, and university system to implement new education laws successfully. Montana students are best served when state agencies work together. I can bring leaders together to expand educational opportunities. I have worked with education committees, the Regents, and executive branch agencies. Montana passed innovative education laws in the last session. As state superintendent, I will faithfully execute the laws of our state and ensure that there are no roadblocks to families accessing the personalized educational opportunities they deserve.

    - question: What do you regard as the most pressing issue facing Montana’s education system?
      response: |+
        The most pressing issue facing our public schools is adequate funding. The state funding formula has not been adjusted for years and consequently school districts are faced with increased costs and fewer resources. Teacher shortages due to low starting salaries, the lack of school counselors and nurses to help keep our students safe and the overwhelming needs for building maintenance and new technology have been neglected due to lack of resources.

    - question: Do you believe changes to Montana’s school finance system are necessary to ensure locally administered school districts have the funding they need to meet their constitutional obligation to provide students with a quality education? What if any changes would you advocate for over the next four years as state superintendent?
      response: |+
        The state’s school funding formula has not been updated in years and consequently schools are not getting the adequate resources they need to operate. Over the last 11 years, I have built relationships with key stakeholders in statewide education including legislators on both sides of the aisle as well as school leaders. I will work with the Montana Legislature in meeting their obligation to update the formula as required by law and as mandated by our state constitution. In addition, the 3% inflationary cap has to be increased to keep pace with the inflation rate today. 

        My other priorities include early childhood education, recruitment and retention of teachers, helping districts meet their building and technology needs and returning the Office of Public Instruction to a respected agency that is responsive to school administrators, teachers and parents.

    - question: Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?
      response: |+
        First, partisan politics don’t belong in our public schools or at the Office of Public Instruction. The role of the state superintendent is to advocate on behalf of the students, educators and families in the state Legislature, the governor’s office, the Board of Public Education, and among school communities. The state superintendent must work with the Legislature and bring clarity to how policy will impact learning at the local level. It is paramount that instruction, services and resource distribution meets the diverse needs of our students with the goal that ALL students are able to learn and thrive.

    - question: The Montana Office of Public Instruction has undergone significant changes during the eight years of Superintendent Elsie Arntzen's tenure. In your opinion, how has Arntzen's leadership changed the agency for good and for ill?
      response: |+
        I am running for state superintendent because I know we can do better. The first order of business after being elected will be to request an independent audit of the financial and programmatic situation at OPI in order to identify major gaps and shortfalls. Rebuilding OPI’s reputation and getting the agency back on track will take hard work and focus. The complaint I hear repeatedly from school districts is that OPI is not being responsive. Not answering the phone and not providing guidance to schools is not unacceptable. Under my leadership, the OPI will be responsive and laser focused on supporting schools. Working with educators, community leaders, business owners and universities over the last 12 years, I know Montana has an abundance of talent that can be tapped to rebuild OPI. I’m ready to take on this challenge and will work tirelessly to build a culture of service and restore the pride we once all had in that office.

        Yes - I would advocate for. simplified and transparent system that ensures equity and elements that address the critical needs of rural Montana districts differently than our larger systems. The second thing I would advocate for is a change to the inflation methods for public schools. Lastly, I would advocate for marijuana dollars for public schools that is guaranteed, not like the lottery for schools that waned. 

    - question: Education policies have become increasingly politicized in recent years. How can state policy help Montana’s public schools balance the diverse ideologies and worldviews of the families they serve?
      response: |+
        1. State policy needs to reflect that values that Montana stands for rather than the ideologies of foreign entities or those striving to rewrite the history of our nation and state.
        2. We all share the same air on this planet and building understanding and appreciation for different cultures and upbringing can be done through expanded exchange programs of teachers and students. As a Rotarian, I was able to send two teachers to India who came back with a strong message: Appreciate public education in America.
        3. Worldviews should be honored in context but never at the expanse of the land where they live: Our views need to see the blessings that come from being an American in the land of the free, home of the brave and one nation under God.

        As the longest tenured deputy during her 8 years (3.5), there were seasons of peace and progress.  Here are three that stand out. 

        1. The Digital Communications team, early in the tenure was on fire and a tremendous asset in capturing and telling educational stories across the state.  This work was great.
        2. Telework implementation during COVID was a reflection of good as it tied strongly to the changing workforce and priorities. 
        3. The focus on the family right-sized the lens of the OPI to remember the power and importance of parents. 

        Challenges: 
        1. The OPI staff turnover, and the loss of staff history - due to lack of systems to ensure systems worked on processes rather than people. 
        2. The waning relationship with the Board of Public Education 
        3. The elimination of monthly representation at MASS meetings - left the impression that the OPI was not so interested in the work of our school leaders or supporting their work.

      response: |+
        I will prioritize the huge rate increases in home and auto insurance as well as all types of insurance the current commissioner has allowed. I'll work hard to bring more insurance carriers to the state in an effort to create competition to help curb these rate increases.

        We will incorporate a Fairness in Rate Increase Information Act whether through administrative rule or legislation that requires insurance carriers to inform their clients anytime they have a rate increase over 10% in any given year.

        Consumer protection and awareness will be a key priority. We will be informing the public on current trends in fraud and deceptive practices that are taking place not only in Montana but nationwide. We will educate the public in email phishing scams, phone scams and other means being used to take advantage of Montana consumers.

        We will aggressively investigate fraud cases and prosecute bad actors to the fullest extent of the law.


    - question: Montanans in some areas are reporting difficulty finding affordable home and property insurance as some companies pull out of markets located within the wildland-urban interface. What, if anything, should the state auditor do to help homeowners in this position?

        We need to actively and aggressively solicit more carriers to come and want to do business in Montana. This will not be an easy task based on the current state of the insurance industry but it will be essential in securing coverage for Montanans across the state.

        The auditor’s office will also become a resource for providing consumers information on how they can better protect their homes through proper wildfire mitigation. I believe if we can prove to insurance carriers that our citizens know how to help protect their property we can find common ground to make coverage more affordable and available to all.

        The role of the state auditor is far reaching and multi-faceted. Consequently, it is hard to name just one important issue to address. But I absolutely will focus on key issues such as making Montana a place where people seeking insurance coverage have numerous policy choices and can find insurance at affordable rates due to a healthy regulatory environment and robust competition. 

        I will also focus on protecting all Montanans from insurance fraud and scams. The underhanded criminals who perpetrate crimes against our seniors and other white-collar criminals will know that there is no place for them to operate in the Treasure State.

        The best way to protect against insurance companies leaving the state is by creating a regulatory environment that makes Montana attractive to do business in. Additionally, incentives could be offered to property or homeowners who undertake their own mitigation efforts. Insurance agents can also be a tremendous asset in this regard because they are on the most local level and will be most accessible to the consumer.

        This is an issue of utmost importance to Montana homeowners and the state auditor will play the pivotal role in finding solutions —  and I will make it a top priority. It is a complex issue requiring the involvement of insurers, risk management organizations, and the state. I would access experts in the relevant fields and staff the office with a knowledgeable team. I will not bring in staff for political purposes. From there, we will learn from other states successes and failures and build a program that works for Montana. 

    - question: The state auditor position has often been a springboard for higher office. If elected, will you commit to serving out your full four-year term rather than making a bid for another position in 2026?
      response: |+
        I have no intent to seek another office and will not only commit to serving the full term as state auditor, but also to being fully engaged in the work of the office during my entire term.

    - question: Briefly describe the legal philosophy you would bring to the bench. As you see it, what is the difference between a good Supreme Court justice and a bad one?
      response: |+
        My legal philosophy is to issue rulings based on the facts of a case and the existing law, to insist that the third branch of government remain co-equal, nonpartisan, and independent, and to ensure every law that is passed or enforced in Montana has its footing in our constitution. In my opinion, a good justice is someone who can write an opinion that may upset his friends and earn the respect of his opponents because that is what the facts and the law require. A bad justice is someone who will contort the law or ignore the facts to suit his own political views, or who will serve only as a rubber stamp for the two political branches of government.

    - question: What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?
      response: |+
        The stakes could not be higher in this election. Montanans of all political stripes face assaults on their constitutional rights and attempts by partisan extremists and out-of-state corporate interests to wrest control of government from the hands of the people. The Montana Constitution is a living document that derives its power from the consent of the governed. If we ignore it, or demean it, or allow it to be chipped away by whatever political party is currently in the majority, we will have only ourselves to blame when our government ceases to function. Instead, we must elect leaders of the judicial branch whose goal is not partisan political gain but the preservation of our constitutional rights, and a government of the people, by the people, for the people. 

    - question: How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?
      response: |+
        It is essential that the judicial branch of government be independent and nonpartisan, and that it be perceived as such. One is a function of the other. So long as the courts are perceived to be independent and nonpartisan, their rulings will be perceived as legitimate, and their orders will be respected. But if courts begin to issue rulings based not on the law and the facts but along political lines, the public’s trust in them will fade and their future rulings will not be perceived as legitimate. I believe the very act of issuing nonpartisan, impartial decisions will ensure that the courts continue to function as the founders intended. And function they must, because the courts are our society’s last line of defense against authoritarianism, oligarchy, and many other political ills.

      response: |+
        My legal philosophy centers on fairness, respect and impartiality. It is rooted in a firm commitment to the rule of law. I approach each case with an open mind, basing decisions on the facts and applicable legal principles presented, rather than on personal beliefs or external pressures. I adhere strictly to the 1972 Montana Constitution, the U.S. Constitution, and established legal precedents and statutes. My long-standing practice is to administer justice fairly, efficiently and without prejudice, promoting both community and economic stability. A good justice understands that the judiciary is a co-equal branch of government that primarily functions as an appellate court, reviewing district court cases on appeal and applications for writs and ensuring that court decisions are fair and constitutional. Additionally, a good justice recognizes the role of the judiciary in keeping the other two branches of government in check. A bad justice fails to grasp these fundamental principals.

    - question: What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?
      response: |+
        The stakes are high because our 1972 Montana Constitution and many of the unique rights it protects — privacy, education, and the preservation of Montana’s pristine landscapes — are facing significant threats. The Montana Supreme Court's decisions profoundly impact everyday Montanans every day, making it crucial to have justices with the integrity, fortitude, and commitment to uphold our Constitution, to protect and defend our Montana values and rights, and to keep the judiciary fair and impartial. With 38 years of combined legal and judicial experience, I am fully prepared to meet that commitment.

    - question: How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?
      response: |+
        The Montana Supreme Court can maintain its independence by ensuring its justices remain impartial and nonpartisan, not swayed by political groups or partisan activities. It is essential for justices to avoid even the appearance of partisanship to maintain public trust and the integrity of our judicial system.

        If I think it is a bad law, but was validly passed and is constitutional, I plan to make a note of that fact, recommending that the Legislature change the law, but will follow the law in my opinions as it is written. I want to be known as a Supreme Court justice that will follow the laws and the Constitution, not one who legislates from the bench. I am open minded.

        The Montana Supreme Court needs to quit legislating from the bench advancing a political philosophy and judicial monopoly. Otherwise there will be a movement to amend the Montana Constitution to put some control over the court, such as making it subject to partisan elections or be subject to a legislative override.

    - question: Briefly describe the legal philosophy you would bring to the bench. As you see it, what is the difference between a good Supreme Court justice and a bad one?
      response: |+
        My judicial philosophy is simple: interpret and apply the provisions of the United States and Montana Constitutions and all laws according to their original intent and plain meaning, and do not allow personal views or the views of special interests to determine the outcome of any case. Respect the rule of law, including the law of precedent, and do not legislate from the bench.

        In my understanding, a good Supreme Court justice subscribes to this philosophy or one similar to it. A bad Supreme Court justice, on the other hand, decides cases based on personal views or preferences rather than basing decisions on higher, governing principles of law. 


    - question: What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?
      response: |+
        Whether Montanans are content or disappointed with various decisions by our Supreme Court in recent years, the stakes for Montanans and our Constitution are the same, regardless of the year or the election. The question is whether we will have a court seen as respectful of the Constitution and the rule of law —  including the law of precedent —  or whether we will have one seen as stepping outside of its own boundaries. For all Montanans, the answer to that question is at stake in this election. 

    - question: How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?
      response: |+
        The Supreme Court must earn the respect of all Montanans by issuing decisions which are firmly rooted in the Constitution and our laws and by providing reasons for its decisions which stand up to the most rigorous standards. When the court lives up to these ideals, it will achieve and maintain its proper role and authority as the independent and non-political decider of the cases that come before it.

      response: |+
        Justices must strive to uphold the rule of law by providing the very best legal interpretation possible to resolve the legal question in each case before us, and also to build a body of case law that others may rely upon. To do so, I would interpret every legal document as a textualist, according to the philosophy of judicial restraint. That means resolve the case before you, not the next five cases you can imagine. That means following precedent unless there is a compelling reason to depart from it, not modifying precedent as it suits you to reach preferred outcomes.

        A good Supreme Court justice should work hard and learn every day. He or she should follow the law to the case's conclusion. He or she should respect the power of the office by not abusing it or disrespecting the litigants. Finally, a good justice should build a professional atmosphere of honest debate and collective learning, not anger or score-settling. A bad justice lets personality get in the way of duty.

    - question: What do you regard as the stakes for who is elected to the Montana Supreme Court this election, both for everyday Montanans and for the Montana Constitution?
      response: |+
        There are two open seats on the Montana Supreme Court this year, which means the court will change significantly, no matter who wins. The chief justice race features two philosophical contrasts.

        If I win, I will try to make the court less about the personality of each Justice, and more about cultivating the wisdom and experience of each member to produce our best legal interpretation. It is not the court's job to actively fight for or against any party or case. It is the court's job to render unbiased and accurate legal opinions that deliver justice to the people. Focus on the law, not the politics.

        The chief justice also advocates for the budget and resources for the entire judicial branch. With my background and commitment to judicial process, I will effectively defend the judiciary in the budget and policy arenas, not perpetuate ill-conceived inter-branch feuds. People are counting on timely and accurate court outcomes, and I will fight for the resources to deliver them.

    - question: How can the state Supreme Court, as the only nominally nonpartisan branch of state government, maintain its independence and avoid politicization?
      response: |+
        To modify a phrase from Chief Justice John Roberts, the quickest way to remove politics from case decisions is to stop deciding cases on the basis of politics.

        The Supreme Court should focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging, no matter the case before it. But some cases are inherently political, so what to do? Just focus on good old-fashioned appellate judging. Follow the rules of interpretation like you would for any case. Let the law lead to the outcome, don't decide the outcome and then modify the law or overturn precedent to get there. That is fundamental to the problem and the solution.

        If the judiciary simply does its job in this manner, then political cases will be just like every other case: the loser will be upset, but the reasoning will be clear and unassailable. The Supreme Court should uphold the rule of law by removing political concerns from its legal interpretations. Let the law be clear, and let the political chips fall where they may.

        When lawyers from the Department of Justice come before the Montana Supreme Court, I’m right at their side helping them prepare. That’s why I’m endorsed by Attorney General Austin Knudsen.

        When conservatives defend election integrity bills at the Supreme Court — like requiring ID to vote — I work right alongside them. That’s why I’m endorsed by Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen.

        When pro-life, pro-family, pro-religious freedom legislation is attacked in the Montana Supreme Court, I'm shoulder to shoulder with those who defend it. That’s why I’m endorsed by the Montana Family Foundation.

        Montana’s long-term energy security depends on maintaining a business-friendly climate for energy investment. As a commissioner, I will work with colleagues in the Legislature and the development community to remove barriers that restrict investment and drive up utility bills.

        Increasingly, Montana’s energy policy is dictated by forces outside our borders. We need Montana-based resources, capable of delivering in all weather conditions.

        Whether it’s at regional energy forums, public hearings before the Environmental Protection Agency, or the Department of Energy, our commissioners need to play a more active role in discussions and decisions impacting customers and generation facilities in the state. I welcome the opportunity to help lead that effort.

    - question: To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?
      response: |+
        I believe the free market should dictate that, and renewables need to stand on their own, in relationship to affordability to the consumer, and not propped up with higher rates or subsidies that the consumer ultimately pays for, either with increased rates, or tax dollars respectively, used to offset the additional cost of any mandate created by climate change policy.

    - question: Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?
      response: |+
        Despite the promise of wind and solar, the intermittent nature of those resources combined with the lack of energy density, and huge amounts of land required mean that wind and solar simply can’t form the bedrock of our energy system. I am, however, intrigued by the research being done in battery storage capacity. As storage capacity becomes greater in respect to time, this will help renewables that have intermittent generation capabilities become a more viable, and therefore affordable option.

        I also see nuclear having some potential down the road, but in my mind, hydrogen shows the most promise as an additional, carbon-free resource that could be produced here in Montana, and has ability to be stored in the ground, to be used on demand at a later time.

        Rounding out renewables, hydro power is still the original clean, green energy. We have infrastructure already in place, so investments in maintaining and improving hydro will remain an affordable option for Montana.

    - question: What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?
      response: |+
        I believe that benefit/cost analysis should be used, but only when coupled with socioeconomic analysis as well. At the time our statutes that regulate the PSC were enacted, it was a foregone conclusion that hydro and fossil fuel would power this state. However, in this day and age with the renewables, and with the development of these, we must keep our eye on the ball, to keep our highly trained workforce on the job. Keeping people working should be the highest priority, in these analyses.

        In addition to artificial intelligence used in calculating cost/ benefit, it's actually people, from management, to skilled labor, and its infrastructure from mines and dams to the generation facilities, all in tandem that bolster its ability to produce reliable power, and sell it for reasonable rates.

    - question: What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?
      response: |+
        Educate the public on the role of the PSC, and like any public process, encourage folks to take an active role in the process itself by communicating with their respective PSC commissioners, and more importantly the ratepayer’s advocate agency, the Montana Consumer Counsel, by having a hand in setting the policy that affects all Montanans.

        Commissioners need to be good listeners and keep an open mind in order to strike a fair balance between reliable and affordable service rates.

        Simply put, its putting people ahead of politics, while also keeping the providers in a position of viability, so they continue to provide vital services to all Montana ratepayers.

        The PSC regulates according to legislation that is in place and really needs to be active in working with the Legislature in legislation that deals with environmental issues. The PSC is not there to regulate based on the personal opinions of the commissioners. In fact, the PSC has gotten into trouble in the past by regulating loosely, or not at all, when some commissioners don't like the legislation that is in place. It is not up to the PSC to decide what legislation they like. Their job is to regulate based on the legislation that is in place.

    - question: Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?
      response: |+
        Montana is behind in implementing "smart" metering that will allow different rates at different times of the day, or days of the week. They are being rolled out now. Technology is the answer, and encouraging customers to use power in the off-peak demand times will help significantly. Using gas that is now flared to run microgenerators will help. New generation such as geothermal, nuclear and micro-hydroelectric generators need to be evaluated and rolled into the energy mix.

    - question: What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?
      response: |+
        First, rate hikes need to be reasonable, only allowed if absolutely required, and the absolute minimum necessary. Net metering needs to be made easy when Montana residents want to implement some form of power generation at their home or business. 

    - question: What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?
      response: |+
        Railroad safety is an area where Montana has some unique requirements. Technology can help tremendously at uncontrolled crossings as well as with roadbed quality issues. Temperature extremes and bad weather make railroad safety more of a challenge here, but we can use technology to overcome some of these challenges. The PSC needs to work with the Legislature and the railroads to use technology to do that.

        The entire West is in a state of collapse as high-capacity energy is challenged at every turn by renewable proponents. Soon, the IOU's (investor-owned utilities) must admit that a subsidy is better than a lengthy and expensive lawsuit that may not be won. Some public utility commissions are begging IOU's to not shutter for there is no replacement power during emergencies like we just experienced. I tried to head that off by writing a bill denying NorthWestern Energy stranded cost if they shut down Colstrip Unit 4 early. They killed it. If it gets critical, we should look at joining an Regional Transmission Authority (an acceptable model does not yet exist) or reconsidering the IOU model. I have already begun this process.

        Many federal mandates need to be revisited i.e., PURPA 210 and the massive subsidies for various renewables. The Montana Supreme Court has upheld many ill-considered district court rulings that raised the cost to consumers. Yet the PSC gets the blame.

        I have the ability to understand complex topics. This is a result of training and multiple career projects. I conducted energy surveys for commercial buildings and provided upgrade recommendations for realizing direct and indirect energy savings. At the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, I served as an energy specialist with the State and Local Initiatives Program where I took technical research and information and reworded it for education and outreach materials. 

        I currently teach two classes: Energy & Sustainability and Energy-Efficient Technologies and Renewable Energy for Gallatin College’s workforce program. The latter class covers the thermal, mechanical and electrical aspects of advanced technologies. I also explain the utility grid including microgrids and smart grid technologies.

        Thus, I am very knowledgeable about energy and would be a quick study on energy and utility topics I need to learn about to properly serve as a commissioner. 

    - question: To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?
      response: |+
        The PSC must address climate change in its decision-making to address ratepayer costs as well as societal and ecosystem health. This can be accomplished while overseeing utility long-term plan development.

        The main way the PSC can address climate change is to give renewable energy projects fair and due consideration because they do not require combustion to generate heat energy or electricity. Thus, when compared to fossil fuels, renewable energy does not emit greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change. Renewables also do not emit pollution that negatively impacts human health. The Montana Climate Assessment provides specific information on how Montana agricultural producers, water resources and our forests are already experiencing negative impacts from climate change. This significantly impacts Montana’s economy. Thus, by addressing climate change, the PSC can protect Montanans in multiple ways. 


    - question: Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?
      response: |+
        Affordable rates can be achieved by implementing efficiency measures on both sides of the meter and by building utility-scale wind and solar electric power plants that are cheaper than fossil fuel-powered plants. Electricity can also be added to the grid from on-site and community solar projects. Renewables are free and not susceptible to volatile market prices. The PSC can invite competition by attracting businesses that build renewable energy projects and participating in western organized energy markets. 

        Renewable energy systems built with battery storage provide reliable electricity available on demand when needed. Our utility grid must be modernized for reliability. Upgrades can include micro-grids that reduce line losses and prevent widespread power outages. Smart-grid technologies give ratepayers control over when and how they use energy to reduce peak demand as well costs. We must also protect the grid from extreme weather events, vandalism and hacking. 

    - question: What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?
      response: |+
        First, direct the utilities to expand and better market current utility energy and water efficiency incentives and rebate programs to lower energy use regardless of the source. This will reduce natural gas and electricity bills. 

        Next, provide the most cost-effective energy source available to us and that is renewable energy with storage. The PSC can approve utility plans to build power plants themselves or the PSC can ensure terms are favorable for attracting other businesses that would build the plants and the utility would buy the power.

        The PSC can also lower power bills by directing the utilities to participate in western organized energy markets for trading and buying cheaper wholesale electricity.

        1. Montana and other western states are increasingly experiencing droughts that reduce the water needed to operate hydroelectric dams and potentially thermoelectric power plants — like Colstrip. This is one other benefit of wind and solar —  they do not require water for operation. Hydropower provides 36% of Montana’s electricity; thus, the PSC must consider this when overseeing utility long-range plan development.

        2. Colstrip’s economy depends on coal and the eventual closing of the power plant due to costs and pollution is a very contentious issue. Past efforts to address were deemed insufficient. Montana's governor, Legislature, NorthWestern Energy and the PSC need to step-up and develop a detailed, coordinated plan. It can include job training and providing incentives to attract companies looking to build. I would invite companies that manufacture components and technologies used for energy- and water-efficient buildings.

    - question: Regulatory matters under the PSC’s jurisdiction are often highly specialized and complex. Please describe your qualifications for performing the technical aspects of the commission's work.
      response: |+
        I possess likely the best attributes for serving on Montana’s Public Service Commission, and that is why I’m running to serve. From day one of my first professional job, I have been responsible for regulatory compliance. I also have significant experience understanding complex technological systems.

        As an engineer, I served as a principal investigator and manager in research and development projects funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). My mission was to gather scientific evidence, analyze data and judge the feasibility of specific technologies related to energy and the environment. This background proves that I have the quality of mind, integrity, commitment, experience, and knowledge to make an excellent public service commissioner for Montana. The PSC is more technical than other elected offices, so expertise matters. I think Montanans should elect candidates who are well-rounded professional experts and not career politicians.

    - question: To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?
      response: |+
        I attended the April 8 hearing where the commission accepted oral public comments on whether Montana’s PSC needs to consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions when approving power plants and gas lines. Some good points were made by both sides. 

        I fully support the PSC’s decision to embrace determining its appropriate role here. However, it would be inappropriate for me, as a candidate to this quasi-judicial body, to publicly take a position. In doing so, I could be challenged as prejudice and get removed from the actual or future related cases. As a commissioner, I will make decisions on this and any other matter only after full, diligent consideration of all the evidence and facts. Please know that my focus will be on the long-term well-being of Montana residents. 


    - question: Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?
      response: |+
        To manage customer affordability, grid access policies in Montana should ensure that all completive forms of energy are treated equally. Montana residents and small businesses will benefit as all cost-effective energy sources are developed and deployed on a level playing field. But the base load supply must be kept sufficient to sustain through prolonged Montana winter conditions. 

        To ensure Montana’s grid reliability, the procurement and production of essential grid components should be advocated for and sourced from Montana when practical, including the mining of copper and the harvesting of lumber. 

        Ideally, Montana should be resource independent and strive to be a net energy exporter. This will bring down our energy costs significantly and at the same time position our Montana economy in a healthier place. With my head for details and a heart for the consumer, I will insist that the corporations always put the wellbeing of ratepayers ahead of groups representing special interests.

    - question: What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?
      response: |+
        As a public service commissioner, I will insist that companies provide the lowest prices with the utmost service reliability and customer care. Ideally, completive free market principles would work. Reality is the job of the Public Service Commission. When on the PSC, I will not engage in corporate protectionism, and instead I will insist that companies pay fully for their bad business decisions. Those costs should never be passed on to the consumer. The PSC should regulate monopolies as though they are operating in a free market economy. The PSC’s role is to protect the ratepayer. It is not to save a monopoly from itself through avoidance of accountability. Regulation must approximate a competitive environment, rewarding good business decisions, while providing incentive for appropriate business discipline.

    - question: What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?
      response: |+
        As your PSC commissioner, I'll be committed to instituting more transparency into the rate-setting process and insisting on a Montana First mentality, while working towards Montana energy independence and future energy solutions.

        Montanans want to more fully understand how utility rates are calculated. As part of an open government process, through public outreach I plan to develop and give educational presentations detailing the steps of rate decisions. Transparency brings accountability to governmental processes.

        I want to see Montana strive for energy independence and have energy solutions planned into the future. I support the development and advancement of all cost-effective energy resources and energy storage technologies. By promoting Montana First regulatory policies, the PSC will best ensure Montana has a strong economy, which correlates to constant, reliable, affordable utilities, as well as a safe and healthy environment in which to continue our Montana way of life.

        Commissioners should have experience that demonstrates they are familiar with economic and investment principles, as well as technical topics such as the generation and transmission of electricity, production and transport of natural gas, and telecommunications.

        I have an engineering degree from Montana State University. I have worked with Montana’s largest energy producers and consumers to help them meet regulatory and production challenges. I have also served as a PSC commissioner from 2013-2016. I will ensure that investments made by our utilities are both technically and economically responsible for the ratepayers of Montana. I will push back on the agendas of the environmentalists using federal policy to push costly technology that doesn’t solve the challenges of today.
    - question: To what extent do you regard climate change as an issue that needs to be addressed by the PSC? What if any actions regarding climate change do you think it’s appropriate for the PSC to consider?
      response: |+
        The PSC has no role regarding climate change. The PSC’s role is to apply regulation that stems from Montana State Law MCA Title 69 and federal law [administered by the] Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). There are some regulations that promote renewables. But it is not the role of the PSC to make regulations. I believe the PSC should work with legislators to understand the effects of any proposed legislation. The PSC has hosted public comments on this topic.

    - question: Montana’s energy grid is facing a major transition as coal plants are taken offline. How should the PSC manage customer affordability and grid reliability as that transition takes place?
      response: |+
        PSC commissioners need to be familiar with federal regulations. The Biden Administration’s “Net Zero” program has plans for building out transmission for wind and solar with a focus on ESG and DEI policies. These policies are a real threat to electricity prices across the state, not just utilities regulated by the PSC, but local co-ops as well. We need our senators, congressmen and the governor to be involved in this debate at both the state and federal level.

    - question: What if any specific actions should be taken by the PSC to reduce Montana consumers’ power bills?
      response: |+
        The PSC has to balance the rates vs. reliability. Currently the three biggest risks to consumers are inflation, higher interest rates and ill-conceived federal regulations. A recent press release from the Department of Energy has announced $6 billion of spending focused on eliminating carbon emissions. 

    - question: What other issues within the PSC’s domain would you prioritize as a commissioner? What specific actions would you encourage regarding those issues?
      response: |+
        I would like the citizens of Montana to benefit from Montana’s resources. The utility generation portfolio should be able to provide a surplus of power that can be marketed to the industrial sector and other states with the benefits of these sales used to relieve the cost to Montana citizens.
