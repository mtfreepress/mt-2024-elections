","The cost of housing, being a mortgage or rental prices are beyond the reach of many workers in my district. 
I would propose a review and update of HB 819 which starts with shared equity ownership program, and low interest loans for attainable housing.
I would also look to update or amend, if necessary, SB 382, The MT Land use Planning Act.
I would propose legislation that creates a state tax credit for workforce housing to work in tandem with LITC, the federal low income tax credit program.
Residential property taxes through appraisals that often don't reflect wealth of an individual is a pressing issue as well for many homeowners and renters in my district.","I was appointed by the governor to serve on the Property Tax Task Force, to clearly identify the problems occurring with our property tax system and offer remedies. I look forward to our recommendations and my role in potentially sponsoring bills to mitigate excessively high taxes in many areas of Montana.
Specifically, about 20% of the residential property tax portfolio is comprised of out of state owners who  are likely part time residents. Perhaps we need to bifurcate the residency category or consider a higher rate for residential taxable values but at the same time offer discounted appraisal values for full time residents. We have about 15 active tax categories, so we need to avoid substantial tax shifts as we address the inequities.
","All Montanan's need health insurance and while impossible to mandate such an outcome, the closer to 100% coverage critical mental and physical healthcare services become more easily available. I think all forms of Medicaid need to be available to eligible Montana's. Last session the legislature fully funded the medicaid reimbursement rate for providers, If the rate falls behind  as has been occurring, providers cannot afford to stay in business. We must stay up to date by addressing funding needs every.
 session. In 2025 Medicaid Expansion is up for reauthorization. A very high percentage of participants are low wage working Montanan's who's access to health care is dependent on the program.  Expansion keeps our very rural hospitals afloat.","First and foremost is the need to fix residential property taxes, so  especially the middle class can  afford potential increases that may occur with any substantial boost to K-12 funding.  There is currently funding that addresses per/student increases up to 3% per year. To address the higher inflation rates of the near past and look at overall boost of the career earning potential of an educator, the state should be willing to provide budget authority to districts to increases through the next biennium budget of a minimum of 5%/year and provide additional state funding for the middle portion of the funding formula known as Guaranteed Tax Base. We must be aware of unfunded liabilities for pensions and  study district consolidations."

The Legislature/Government is ignoring the people and making life more difficult for long standing residents.  Changes in the tax system that rewards out of state and high-income corporations places more burdens on the everyday worker.  In addition, the Legislature is extremely driven to intrude on a woman’s right to privacy and wants to make healthcare decisions on their behalf.

Along with this is to suspend property tax increases for senior citizens.

The legislature needs to modernize the participation rate to the local government/schools which is a better use of the tax resources.

Montana needs to renew Medicaid Expansion.  If not, this could be disastrous for Montana businesses whose employees get their health coverage through this service.  Not renewing this measure could jeopardize the financial solvency for our hospitals, care centers and senior living facilities and limit all healthcare service all over.
",Montana continues to slip on the commitment to education.  Funding has been abysmal and Montana teachers are now the lowest pay in the nation.

Access to healthcare isn't just about financial costs; it's about enabling participation in communities—working, volunteering, supporting families—that enriches society.

 2. Healthcare:  I would vote to continue the Medicaid program extension, and I would advocate to reinstate those citizens who were dropped from the rolls for administrative mistakes. 
3. Reproductive Rights: I would immediately vote to adopt CI 128 - the abortion rights amendment, once it has gathered sufficient signatures to be on the ballot and has been approved by the electorate.","The 2023 Legislature transferred the burden of property tax directly onto homeowners, reducing the burden on corporations and the very wealthy . The most effective way to solve the problem is to re-balance the burden and reduce the residential property tax rate from 1.35% to 0.94%, as the DOR recommended in 2021.

We need an automatic property tax exemption which provides a tax refund for residents unable to pay specifically veterans and senior citizens.
We need to require that large profitable corporations, millionaires, and billionaires pay their fair share of taxes.  

Ensuring that the stipulations of SB 442 are enforced is critical to maintaining a healthy tax system in Montana by funding county roads.","First and foremost, I would vote to extend the Medicaid program. I would advocate to reinstate those citizens were dropped from the rolls for administrative mistakes. Medicaid allows people to obtain medical services that keep them healthy, on the job, and able to care for their families. Medicaid payments help medical providers to stay in business, a real issue in rural Montana. ","The MFPE and the Governor’s Office negotiate a base pay increase for public employees. I will vote to ratify that base pay increase rate for all state and university employees.

Public schools were obviously underfunded in both the 2021 and 2023 legislative sessions, in part because actual inflation after Covid-19 was much higher than the 3 % cap, causing school funding to fall further and further behind. I will advocate for a more realistic inflation cap to be reviewed annually.

Prior to that, most of my working life was spent at non-profits. I also served four years of active duty in the U.S. Army, where I suffered injuries affecting my mobility.
Because of the work I pursued, I understand the needs of Montana's low-income populations, veterans and folks with disablities. As a single woman who raised a grandchild, I can attest to the difficulties faced by Montana families. 
Before acting, I will ask, ""Who does this help?""","Montanans are  guaranteed privacy and thus bodily autonomy, but we must remain vigilant. I would support legalizing abortion and legislation allowing identity care decisions be between patients and doctors.
Our Montana Constitution also guarantees the right to a clean and healthful environment. We must work at decreasing fossil-fuel consumption and do better at monitoring pollutants in our environment. Low-income, highly industrialized areas, like parts of Laurel, need air quality monitors and better information on the negative effects of pollution on our health.
Other issues I am concerned with include: access to and protection of public lands; raising the minimum wage; expanding Medicaid; and protecting our agricultural industry.","While property taxes for homeowners has risen about 20%, industry has been given a pass. Overall, large industrial taxes have fallen. As an example NWE, the state's largest taxpayer, saw a decrease of 20%, paying $36 million less than the previous year. Reform of property evaluations need to be instituted, ensuring homeowners don't shoulder so much of the burden.
To assist elderly and poor homeowners qualify for relief, I would support a system that automatically enrolls low-income property owners based on their state tax return.","Firstly, the state needs to re-enroll everyone who was kicked off Medicaid during the recent purge. Montana disenrolled more folks faster than almost any other state--adversely affecting not only the health of children and other vulnerable people, but endangering rural health centers and providers, which rely on Medicaid reimbursement to remain in business.
Given that the federal government pays 90% of the related costs, Montana legislators should take advantage of that, and further Medicaid expansion. ","The funding formula is extremely complex, but based primarily on the number of students enrolled in a school district, with a 3%  increase every year. With inflation exceeding that number, the increase needs to at least match inflation so districts can keep up with expenses. Unlike school funding, teacher salaries are paid through the General Fund and determined by the legislature. 
I would support simplifying the formulary for funding schools and providing districts with some spending flexibility depending on their needs. The legislature needs to ensure quality educators are rewarded and should increase teacher base pay.
No funds for public schools should be allocated to private charter schools.

","Property Tax Relief – A rapid increase in residential property values combined with cuts in the state income tax has disproportionately shifted an increasing amount of the tax burden onto home owners.  It is a travesty that so many Montana citizens are struggling to pay these significant increases while the property taxes paid by Governor Gianforte on his Helena mansion actually went down!  See suggestions to remedy this situation below in answers to question 3.  Other issues: expand Medicaid (it is good for the economy and good for our people), keep public lands in public hands (let the Feds pay for firefighting while we enjoy the forests), mitigate climate change (creating new technology jobs to power a clean future).","What is needed is a more equitable system of taxation.  One solution would be to raise the property tax rate and then provide a ""homestead tax credit"" to Montanans on their primary residence.  The effect will be to shift the burden onto wealthier Montanans with second homes and onto out-of-state residents with vacation homes in Montana.  There is some justice in this , since the rapid increase in property values has been caused in part by non-residents buying up property & thereby raising housing costs for locals.  To raise more revenue, recent income tax cuts will need to be reversed.  We could consider a sales tax; however, a sales tax is regressive falling most heavily on those least able to afford it.  Better to institute a luxury tax .","1.  Medicaid needs to be expanded.  Medicaid is paid primarily by the Federal government and even generates a  27 million dollar surplus.  2.  Six million dollars of the Cannabis tax goes to the HEART account for addiction treatment.  As this revenue increases, instead of a fixed dollar amount, HEART should receive a percentage of the revenue.  3. In 2022, over 100,000 Americans died of an overdose.  States sued opioid distributors and won.  Montana currently has 2.4 million in its opioid settlement fund.  More money will be coming in over the next 20 years.  So far, none of this money has been spent.  It should be utilized as a plentiful source of funding for health care, especially for drug addiction treatment programs.","The state needs to raise additional tax revenue and earmark this for education (see question 3 above).  The state must utilize every federal dollar available in the Head Start and Early Head Start programs to pay for pre-k education.  These programs yield improved long-term outcomes for children in otherwise disadvantaged economic conditions.  Plus, they essentially provide free child care allowing the parent to enter the work force and become a more productive tax paying citizen.  Vocational programs should be available in high school and after graduation.  These programs produce tradespeople who make good wages and pay more taxes.  Voucher programs and charter schools are NOT the solution.  They drain funds from the public school system. "

It provides hard-working, low-paid Montanans access to general medical care and, significantly, care for mental illness and substance abuse when they need it.

Medicaid expansion is keeping urban hospitals and clinics financially healthy and rural critical access hospitals alive.

It supports about 7,500 jobs and generates about $475 million in personal income and $700 million in economic activity. 

Finally, between budget savings and increased tax receipts, Medicaid expansion pays for the state’s investment.

Continuing Medicaid expansion is the right thing to do for Montana’s people, healthcare infrastructure, economy and state budget.","The Montana legislature needs to decrease the residential property tax rate from 1.35 to 0.94 percent which the Department of Revenue advised in November 2022 and the Republican legislature and Republican governor ignored.

The Republicans’ inaction continued a trend of shifting tax responsibilities away from industrial properties, which corporations use to generate income, onto residential properties where people raise their families. This time, the residential share of total property taxes increased 5 percent and the industrial share decreased 5 percent.

Montana needs to go back to asking corporations to pay their fair share.","After reauthorizing Medicaid expansion, the best thing the Montana legislature could do to advance healthcare, including mental healthcare, is to ask the governor to appoint a competent director for the Department of Pubic Health and Human Services.

DPHHS is embarrassingly behind in paying for services. At the end of March 2024, RiverStone Health was down $2.2 million from its anticipated Medicaid revenue.  

DPHHS has dropped nursing home residents, individuals in assisted living, disabled people and children from Medicaid not because they were ineligible but because they could not navigate the arcane and disorganized reapplication process.

DPHHS needs a new director.","I don’t pretend to understand the school funding formula nor how to explain how to improve it in 750 characters or less but here are some things.

Because schools are so important in so many ways, I believe that it is fair to ask taxpayers to support a good school system. I do not think it is fair to ask taxpayers to pay for private schools on top of that. I oppose using tax money to support private schools.

Industrial properties are hard to evaluate and there is a cap on how much their taxes can increase. Residential properties are easy to evaluate and have no cap on increases. We need to look at caps and we need better ways to evaluate industrial property values.

We need to look at how we tax multi-million dollar vacation properties."

A heavy emphasis on mental health training & trauma informed practices, especially for police, EMTs & schools. ","This is the area I feel I could have the most impact.  If elected I would love the opportunity to serve on both educational policy & budget committees.  
We are heading into the 10 year cycle of reassessing the school funding formula.  
We need to assess the inflationary funding cap at a 3% max.  We know that the increases just to keep the lights on have far exceed a 3% increase.  Additionally, the needs of students continue to increase.  
Recruitment & Retention is extremely difficult, causing staffing to be at crisis levels.  Looking at opportunities to increase funding to pay better and offer better benefits is critical.

I have met people from all across Montana and I have been able to relate to them and work with them.  I have volunteered for most of my life, whether it be on the fire department, church, or youth sports and school activities.","My most pressing issue is the lack of foresight our current legislature is showing.  We are last in the nation for starting pay for public teachers.  How can we educate our youth if we don't show support for schools.  This past year Montana had about 10% of the   teacher positions open.  How is that benefiting our children?  We also passed, but it thrown out in court laws which would have allowed mining waste water to be dirtier than the federal rules permit.  The federal rules as are base line which a state can make more stringent.  However, our legislature and governor decided it was Montanans' best interest to have the the dirtiest water in the nation.  There is no looking into the future in Helena, all vision is nearsighted.  ","Our governor could have made an adjustment to the tax rate, as many governors have done before.  I believe this was done to create a push to install a sales tax in Montana.  A sales tax would negatively affect year-round residents and only benefit the rich part-timers who do not spend a high percentage of their money in Montana.  We need to tax vacation house rentals such as Air B&Bs, as commercial properties.  This revenue can be used to offset residential taxes.  We need to adjust the value of vacation homes, where people live in Montana less than six months and are not residents.   ","We need to extend expanded medicaid beyond 2025.  Health care is vital and should be a fundamental right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   Many Montanans need the financial help that this program affords. Without Medicaid, many citizens would not see a health care professional when they first feel sick due to cost.  It has been proven that it is way more cost effective to have expanded Medicaid than to have to pay emergency room expenses and to help prevent catastrophic illnesses which are more expensive to treat.  Without expanded medicaid, many rural health care facilities would have to shut their doors.  Then we are putting a burden on families to travel great distances to see loved ones.","The first thing we must undo is allowing government money to go to private schools.  If someone wants to send their child to a private school, good for them.  They should not expect our tax dollars to help fund this private education.  One of the greatest success stories is public education in the US.  We need to educate the next generation of Montanans, with a poor education system our children will leave the state.  "

I plan on bringing my common sense conservative approach to the State Legislature to help create and maintain a more prosperous Montana. ","Taxes, Inflation and Public safety are at the top of my list. Out of control spending at all levels of government have devalued the US dollar and caused prices of common goods, activities and property taxes to spike across the board. This has created less opportunity for our citizens and harbored low moral environment. This leads to crime, poverty and low standard of living. I will work with all members of the Legislature and continue to work with my community toward solutions. Rein in Government spending at all levels, Increase funding where it is needed to fight crime and strive to provide Montanans with a lower cost of living. ","When it comes to high property taxes, the root problem is inflation. Devaluing the US dollar has driven prices higher in every aspect of our lives. Property taxes have risen partly because of inflated home prices, which result in higher tax assessments. Another large problem is the wasteful spending at all levels of government. From DC to City hall. The traditional “spend all you can to get all you can” must stop. I support lowering taxes for Montanans at all levels. Tax caps, Assessment rules and caps, re thinking how we create and maintain budgets at state and local levels. I plan on bringing my common sense business forward, balanced spending approach to help solve the now glaring tax problems we face. ",Medicaid expansion is a subject that deserves much attention and consideration. Montanans are struggling in rural as well as urban areas to find adequate health services. Help from the Legislature is needed to cut the red tape involved in acquiring adequate mental and physical health care for all and especially less fortunate Montanans. Mental health is the root of so many problems we face in Montana. Everyone deserves a helping hand when they are willing or unable to help themselves. ,"This is a subject that will require a lot of out of the box thinking. New approaches to raise revenue for our schools is paramount in maintaining a prosperous Montana. Less wasteful spending. School budget reform. More independent fundraising. Less costly regulation. More incentive for good teachers. Reform of Tax revenue and how funds are allocated and spent. The funding is there. I believe that a common sense business minded look at the way those funds are spent, would go a long way! "

Active in running community, schools, BridgerCare, business mentoring. Also lived (Hungary, Israel, South Africa) and worked abroad. Love our shared public lands (ultra runner). I want to set aside partisan differences so we can work together to help Montanans become the best version of themselves, and to manage the state better than it has been managed these past few years.","(1) Women’s rights: I will defend equality, the right to personal privacy, and the MT State Constitution. (2) Property taxes: (a) The increase was a mistake that we should fix immediately (b) Montana residents should pay a lower tax than non-residents.  (c) Renters should not be forgotten. (3) Growth and Affordable Housing: Allow local community input. (4) Medicaid Expansion: Brings medical care, money, and stabilizes the rural healthcare infrastructure. (5) Income tax fairness: We should use our success to invest in the present { bridges and roads} and in the future {public schools, wildlife protection, affordable housing}, instead of destabilizing our finances and shifting tax burden to lower wage earners, like the 2023 Legislature did.","(1) Previous legislatures fixed the property tax formula to be fair and not too different from last year’s. The 2023 Legislature didn’t do this, resulting in residential increases and cuts for large corporations. The responsibility lies with the Legislature, not the counties or local governments. Fixing the formula is easy and I’ll join others to make it happen. (2) I propose (a) we set the proportionality of the Residential tax component at a fixed percentage of the Total Property Tax to be Collected, and (b) tax “2nd homes” and “short-term rentals” owned by non-residents at a higher rate than residents pay. (3) Fix the tax system so we can secure funding for public schools from the General Fund. I will learn and offer solutions as I can.","(1) Our humanity is defined by how we treat one another. Providing mental and physical health care services is not only the right thing to do, it also is cost-effective and will save taxpayers money in the long run. (2) The Legislature should support Medicaid Expansion that has provided needed health care coverage for working Montanans, helps families and small businesses that rely on these workers, especially important in rural parts of the state. (3) Support local non-profits to provide mental health and service support. (4) Increase funding for substance abuse and mental health programs.  (5) DPHHS should do a better job reimbursing local programs and be compassionate in keeping people on assistance rather than trying to kick them off,","Investing in safe, quality education for our children must be a priority. (a) At the least, the current budget cap on inflation increases should be reformed to match inflation. (b) We are a successful state, and there is no better investment a government can make in its people than through public education – we should set a healthy school budget and adjust as needed. (c) We should invest in better pay for teachers and school workforce, including using the state’s success to provide financing support for housing. (d) We should invest in pre-K, with a sensitivity to include current providers. (e) I also strongly support university and vocational program expansion and access, as well as looking to reduce the financial burden on participants."

Along with recently becoming a small business owner, I have spent the last decade of my career working on democratic campaigns and as an aide in the Montana Legislature. I grew up in Helena's public schools and have chosen to come back to this community time after time. I have a deep appreciation for and a thorough understanding of the law making process and the dynamic politics it requires to get there. ","Undoubtedly, the most pressing and consequential issue facing the 2025 Montana Legislature is the conclusion of Medicaid Expansion and the dire need for it to be renewed. Not only does Medicaid Expansion allow hundreds of thousands of Montanas security regarding their health insurance, it also provides tens of thousands of Montana kids access to pediatric care. Medicaid also ensures that rural hospitals across Montana are able to keep their doors open to provide lifesaving care. I was working in the Montana Legislature in 2019 when Medicaid Expansion was first passed -- and let me assure you, it was not passed easily. It required political acumen in order to secure the vote of moderate republicans and an acute understanding of the process. ","To lower taxes on residential property, the Legislature should rebalance the property tax system by making sure corporations and businesses pay a fairer share of the property tax burden. One way to do this would be to provide a ""homestead exemption"" for individual property owners. This would exempt some part of the homeowner’s market value from taxation, lowering the residential property tax burden for homeowners and increasing the costs that corporations and businesses have to pay. ","I have always firmly believed that taking care of people is the single most important role of our government. That is, in fact, why I was drawn to this work in the first place. For a while now, our government has not been working for most people, especially our lower-income friends and neighbors. Arguably, the most thing our Legislature has control over is if and how much to fund Medicaid in our state during this upcoming legislative session.","Most, if not all, public schools in our state are massively underfunded. In order to better and more sustainably fund our public schools, I would start with revising our tax structure to place more responsibility on the wealthiest Montanans and the multi-million dollar corporations doing business in our state. Additionally, I would restructure how recreational marijuana tax is being distributed within our counties – taxing higher and sending more to our public schools. Further, I would have a much larger discussion about how the hundred million dollars received annually by the Montana Lottery is being allocated out of the general fund. "

While our students and their families are very well served by Montana's public educators and locally governed school districts, mounting evidence suggests they are struggling to meet the needs of their students with the available resources. We have a moral and constitutional imperative to invest in our children's education, and the failure to do so will also undermine economic growth and opportunity. The next Legislature must bolster our investment in Montana's children.","Montana families are understandably concerned about the drastic increase in their residential property taxes which have substantially outpaced inflation. However, we must recognize that property taxes are a critical source of investment in public education and many other public goods. Article VIII of the Montana Constitution diagnoses the problem and compels the solution: ""The state shall appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property which is to be taxed in the manner provided by law."" Our current system places an unfair burden on residential property owners. The next Legislature must ensure that we equalize residential home valuations with corporate and other business property classes.","The Montana Legislature joined 41 other states in 2015 to expand Medicaid coverage, which has enabled many Montanans in low-income jobs or part-time work due to disabilities to afford healthcare. By providing access to mental and physical healthcare services, more Montana children were able to attend school and learn while more people were able to continue working to support their families. Furthermore, the vast majority of the costs are paid for by the federal government. Investing in the health of our low-income children and families is not only a moral imperative, but a widely acclaimed policy to bolster our economy and reduce state expenditures. The next Legislature must renew Medicaid expansion.","Public school districts across Montana are facing growing budget deficits while doing their best to support and educate our children, an increasing number of whom are struggling with poverty, isolation, and pandemic related learning loss. We must ensure that our state funding formula is addressing the growing needs of our students while keeping pace with the increasing costs of meeting their needs.

We are leaving a lot of revenue on the table by not having a statewide sales tax that would be collected on not only our 1.1 million residents but also our 12 million nonresident visitors.

I served on the Taxation Committees in the past, and know first hand that homeowner and small business property taxes need a rate reduction--an approach used in the past by legislature. Health care is critical to our community, as we've had several nursing home closures, and I will work on initiatives dealing with senior care, housing affordability, public education.  The recent purge of Medicaid recipients will negatively impact health care for everyone, and jeopardize the financial viability for rural health care providers. ","As noted, during previous reappraisals, there was bipartisan support to reduce the property tax rates for homeowners and small business.  This approach (although recommended in Nov, 2022) was ignored and resulted in over $200 million in permanent property tax increases for homeowners/small businesses. The blame on local governments is factually incorrect.  We need to lower the rates and stop  the ongoing shift of property taxes from large corporations to homeowners.  Homeowners are now paying over 50% of property tax; we need to  adjustthe appraisal process/valuation for other classes of property tax to ensure fairness,  expand senior citizen exemptions (on property tax), include renters in our efforts and continue expanding housing.","First, the state needs to take quick meaningful action to requalify those eligible for Medicaid!  The state leadership kicked off twice as many folks as projected;  70,000 were terminated due to the state's procedural problems. This means., forefeiting  millions of dollars in Federal funding(our tax dollars).  and raising health care costs for everyone.  the DPHHS Director needs to be terminated. The legislature should pass legislation to renew and fund the state share of Medicaid Expansion and reinstate 12 month eligibility.  The legislature, unfortunately, may need to ""micro manage"" this process; i.e. add temporary staff. We also need to expand health access in rural areas.  ","School funding is complicated. However,  coordination between OPI and local school districts (for budgeting) has suffered under the current OPI leadership and needs fixing. Next, we need to eliminate the charter school concept that is exempt from local control and stop siphong money from public schools.  I would propose changes to the school funding formula to increase the state share. Also, the property tax system needs adjusting to ensure equalization.  We need to provide resources for students so they can get workforce training or college credits while high school (other states do this) and consider putting more funding in programs rather than buildings.

Property taxes: Legislators had ample time and opportunity to fix the personal property tax debacle we currently find ourselves in, but the governor’s office instead chose to send out rebate checks instead of fixing the problem. Thankfully, Montanans saw through the charade and voiced their strong opposition. Legislation is needed to adjust personal property tax rates.

I don’t think that is a solution.",Expand Medicaid enrollment - Medicaid expansion is critical for the healthcare of many Montanans and is especially important in rural communities that run the risk of losing medical services if the legislature does not act.  The Federal government covers 90% of the cost - this is not a difficult decision.,"As an 11+ year school board member and a product of our public schools, I understand many of the challenges schools face.  If we want to retain high quality educators, they need to be paid a living wage.  I wonder why some legislators claim they support increased teacher pay and school funding, then turn around and vote against it.

My career as an educator has led me to doing union work for Bozeman educators, and I have also stepped up to represent our state level public employee union as a vice president.  Through this work I have seen the need to work for and protect the middle class by pushing for fair wages, healthcare, retirement with dignity, and safe working conditions.  I think that it is also beneficial to representing the district that I was born in, graduated high school in, got my first job in, etc.  I know my community and I am a proud of it.","Property taxes, education funding and medicaid expansion. Property taxes are part of a fair tax system that works for every Montanan.  The legislature along with the governor need to use the tools at our disposal to adjust tax rates so corporations pay their share.  Education funding is a disaster.  We need to include a cost of living allowance into our formula for districts that are in high cost of living communities in Montana.  Medicaid expansion is necessary for many reasons including keeping access to healthcare in our rural areas.  The work is in process and I will be supporting it in every way I can.",I would absolutely support changes to our tax system to help working Montanans find relief with property taxes.  3 things that I would support are equalizing property taxes to shift the 11% increase on residential back to highly profitable corporations in Montana. I would support a homestead exemption so primary homes are taxed at a lower rate.  I would also push to bring the tax rate for high income earners back up to the level it was before the 2023 session.  All of these options together would bring tax relief for home owners in Montana.,"Medicaid expansion is a primary focus this next session.  We must lift the sunset on the program so we can continue to support healthcare across our state.  We started a 300,000 program for mental health and we need to make sure we see that work through and see that the people that need help are getting it.  I think we need to also do a better job providing for the healthcare of our youngest citizens.  No child should be without healthcare!  I will support any legislation that strengthens our system for all Montanans. ","I believe that we are not currently funding education as our constitution demands.  The concept of quality education has been manipulated to leave us with a system that is struggling to meet the basic needs of our students.  The cost of living in MT has changed over the years and the difference in cost of living across the state is now disparate.  The school funding formula has no way to account for that and it is past time to do so.  In addition, the cap on inflationary increase for school funding has effectively caused education funding to fall farther and farther behind!  We must fix both of these problems in the next session."

Educated people enjoy more satisfying and productive lives whether they learn the trades or a profession.  They are less likely to suffer homelessness.  They can participate effectively in the political process which leads to better government.  I will work to bring control of education back to local government and parents and away from bureaucrats in Washington.  Solve this problem and we solve all the other problems facing the nation.,"The formula for calculating property taxes is not the problem. 
The problem is that we the people continue to demand more services which have to be funded by more taxes.  We must seek ways to make government more efficient at providing the services we expect from it whether it is education, housing, public safety, etc.","Government is not efficient at providing healthcare, either through insurance (Medicare) or directly (Veterans Administration).  They are rife with mismanagement and fraud which result in higher costs.  Without government restrictions, treatment and medicines would be much cheaper.  High quality care can be maintained if doctor and hospital performances are published instead of being shielded by the Board of Medical Examiners.  COVID proved that we can bring effective and safe medicines to market without the long and costly process currently in force.  Help for lower-income Montanans should come from private groups who know and care about the recipients instead of government bureaucrats simply looking to preserve their jobs.",Throwing more tax money at schools will not solve the problem which is not so much the amount of money available as it is the way that money is spent.  Schools with falling enrollment and/or performance should be merged or closed.  The administrative burden on schools should be reduced so that we can focus on teachers.  Maintenance should not be put off until it is critical and expensive.  Schools should be required to report on scholastic performance and how our taxes are being spent.  Parents must be more active in oversight.  Private solutions (vouchers and charter schools) should be encouraged.

As a first-generation college graduate, raised by a single mom due to the death of my dad when I was young, I learned the value of public education and hard work.  Through scholarships, loans and public medical school, I was able to become a doctor who specialized in pediatric cancer care and then pediatric hospice.  Through this I learned that the most complicated decisions are extremely personal and require listening carefully to family and patient values in order to best advocate for them.  I would do the same for my voters.

","There are many pressing issues that need legislation and advocating for change.  However, I think the most pressing issue that needs addressing prior to or while proposing legislation is communication.  Connecting across the aisle and having civil conversations for shared, sensible solutions is imperative.  I do realize that this requires effort on both sides of the aisle.  If elected, I will do what I have done when I testified, as a citizen, in Helena in the 2023 session and work to connect across the aisle while still standing up for my values and the needs of the voters.","I support lowering the residential tax rate, when assessed taxable values skyrocket as they did this year.  I support eliminating the ability for centrally-assessed companies (telecom, railroads and others that cross county lines) to negotiate their tax rates or at least make the negotiations transparent to the public.  I support allowing local communities to enact tax decisions that make sense for their communities.","I believe that the Legislature must ensure that health insurance for our lower income Montanans, which is usually Medicaid, continues and is not put in jeopardy each session.  This healthcare should cover mental health services and provide care for those with substance use issues.  Our rural and critical access hospitals are essential for rural Montanans and depend on Medicaid to remain fiscally viable and available to provide care services to patients in those areas.  Without these hospitals and this healthcare coverage, the health of many Montanans will be harmed.","The problem with funding at the pre-K-12 level, as with higher education and vocational training programs, is adequacy. We are not dedicating the level of funding necessary to meet our constitutional promise to develop the full educational potential of all persons. We need to pay teachers at a level that will attract and retain them, whether in a kindergarten or a college. We need to support curriculum at a level that ensures students can develop their unique talents, as well as have their unique needs met.  We need to ensure that college is affordable so that the debt level college graduates assume and the housing crisis they face in Montana will not force them to leave the state."

As a life-long MT resident, I am invested in our state with my whole heart.  This is my forever home.","The believe the most pressing issue for the 2025 legislative session is the reality that many Montanans can't afford to live in our beautiful state.  As a legislator, I would propose and support legislation that requires all MT residents to pay their fair share of taxes and state government is held accountable for how our tax dollars are being spent.  The money our state collects in taxes must be spent wisely.  As legislators, we must not pass laws that are unconditional or have unconditional elements that send us down the path of litigation.  Dollars spent on legal fees should instead be allocated for increase in salaries for our law enforcement officers, fire fighters and to support our veterans along with lowering property taxes.  ","I believe we have to make changes on how Montana funds public schools to help decrease our property taxes.  The Montana Constitution guarantees that all students receive a fair and quality public education.  The basic entitlement for all schools needs to be increased by using state funds.  While the push for charter schools may increase opportunities for some students, inevitably our state will not be able to adequately support our public schools.  With increased state funding, schools won't need to run levies, therefore reducing the tax liability of our residents.  I believe a primary residence should be taxed at 75% of the assessed value.  We should encourage more film making in MT and negotiate a portion of proceeds to fund the tax base.","A healthy Montana is a great Montana.  Health care access should not be a privilege but a right for all Montana residents, regardless of their financial status.  I believe the legislature and other government leaders should work together to ensure our residents can access medical care through ride share vouchers to clinics, offer incentives to healthcare providers for working in the most rural parts of our state, especially our reservations, and help with getting medications at a lower cost.  We need to hire more health care advocates that also provide information and support on how to live a healthy lifestyle.  ","A public school education is the greatest equalizer we have.  The Montana school funding formula needs to be changed.  As an educator for the past 30 years in a K-12 school, I have witnessed first-hand the repercussions of inadequate school funding.  As I mentioned before, we need to ensure all Montana residents are paying their fair share of taxes.  We need to eliminate unnecessary spending of our tax dollars.  I believe we should research the idea of a state wide salary schedule for educators to attract quality applicants.    Furthermore, the state needs to institute a policy that they will reimburse the cost of a grant writer for each school (K-12, college/universities and vocation education program).  "

This will give us the chance to most effectively address pressing issues, such as providing property tax relief, increasing the supply of attainable housing for our workforce, revamping our mental health system, and bringing innovation into our public schools.  I will be working with other legislators to find solutions to these and other challenges that face Montanans."," Property taxes exclusively go toward funding schools, cities, and counties.  So cutting local spending would reduce taxes but also would likely cause a reduction in services.  Without spending cuts, reducing tax rates shifts the tax burden between property classes (e.g., from residential to agricultural and commercial) or to income tax payers.  I am presently one of six legislators serving on Governor Gianforte’s property tax task force, which is carefully weighing several options.  Among the most promising is a homestead exemption for a Montana resident’s primary home.  Another is expanding current safety net programs for fixed income homeowners.  ","The legislature in 2025 will consider reauthorization of the Montana HELP Act.  Here are facts that will influence my position on this action:  Most enrollees work (72%), while 23% are disabled, caretakers, or students.  About 60% of Montana businesses have employees enrolled in the program.  The financial viability of rural healthcare facilities depends on Medicaid funding; otherwise, they must provide uncompensated care to the poor.  The program does not increase funding of abortion because poor women are already eligible for Traditional Medicaid—the same program that covers the elderly.  Enrollment decreases when the economy improves.  Any effective program must include work requirements.","The current school funding formula was crafted to meet the state's constitutional obligation to provide adequate and equitable funding of Montana's public schools.  It achieves that objective.  That said, it will undergo its next decennial study immediately after the 2025 session comes to a close.  This will provide us the opportunity for a thorough and thoughtful update of the formula.  One thing that I plan to work on for the 2025 session is relooking the inflation adjustment that is in the formula.  In the meantime, the legislature has implemented and is expanding programs to expand career and technical education programs, to encourage innovation in our public schools, and to increase starting pay for new teachers.

The program not only serves Montanans in need, including children and seniors, but also sustains many of our small rural hospitals.  Without reauthorization of the program, many of those hospitals will not be financially sustainable, creating additional barriers to healthcare for thousands of Montanans.","Presently local taxing authorities are limited to increasing their budgets by one-half of the rate of inflation.  Wages and benefits can not be sustained when budgets don't keep pace with inflation, leading to staffing reductions and difficulty recruiting and retaining staff.  Ultimately, services are impacted.  To sustain budgets and reduce the burden on residential property tax payers the legislature needs to rebalance the tax burden among the sixteen classes of property, reducing the residential property tax burden.  Montana's three propert tax assistance programs, the PTAP (Property Tax Assistance Program), the Elderly Homeowners' Credit and the Disabled Veterns Program need to be expanded to serve more Montanans in need.","As I previously indicated, it is critical that the legislature reauthorize the Montana Medicaid program.  Additionally, reimbursement schedules need to be enhanced in order to sustain rural hospitals.  In the past two years, twelve Montana nursing home have closed due to low reimbursement rates making them financially unsustainable.  Due to the rural nature of so much of our state it is also imperative that access to telehealth be expanded, particularly with regard to behavioral and mental health.",Montana's beginning teachers' salaries rank 51st in the nation (less than all fifty states and Washington D.C.)  Recruitment and retention of teachers is increasingly difficult given the cost of housing in Montana's urban settings.  State revenue from resource extraction and income taxes (not property taxes) must be devoted to enhancing the state budget for education. In 2023 we had a state budget surplus in excess of one billion dollars; as a result of our expanding economy we are currently on pace to have a surplus of $785 million in January of 2025.  More resources must be allocated to rectify our failure to adequatey fund K-12 education and the Montana University System.

I also would support innovative ideas for funding education that don't require deforestation or selling off state lands. ","I do not believe that the state should be run like a business, though I do believe state programs should be run efficiently and serve the most needy in a fiscally responsible manner. Addressing child hood poverty, addiction, affordable housing mental and physical health as well as workers rights are important functions of the state and will lead to a healthier, happier population. 
","Though I don't claim to have the answers, I have a lot of ideas. I think it would be worth discussing a flat tax and fair distribution of education dollars regardless of the prosperity of a given district. Education is such a great investment in the state and should include college, vocational education, apprenticeships, and especially preschool through grade 12.
Solving this problem will take out-of the-box thinking which may make some people uncomfortable. Living in Whitefish I also have seen the benefits of a small sales tax."

","Taxes (see below), illegal immigration, fixing our mental health system. 
Illegal immigration is impacting Montana as it is being used as the vehicle by which much of the illegal drugs are being smuggled in to our state. In addition some employers are using illegal immigrants as labor to unfairly compete with business of  more integrity.  We need to pass laws that deter their presence in our state and make hiring them illegal. 
Our mental health system is failing, this is obvious when Warm Springs was delicensed. The result is when Law Enforcement encounters the mentally ill they often charge them and jail them instead of sending them into the state mental health system which has no bed space. This results in less space in our jails. ","First the Montana property owner must be protected from the unpredictable swings in property values and the value assessment system. For the purposes of taxes the property values need to be frozen. The state needs to further diversify its tax structure so no single source carries the burden of funding services. This state is abundant in natural resources, but our efficient use of these (a source of tax revenue) has been hampered by overzealous environmental concerns. We need to offer reasonable solutions so that these resources are reengaged as part of our economy.  Tourism is bringing billions of dollars to this state, but there is also an impact to our services and roads. We need to expand how we collect fees from those who come to visit.","We should revisit the Medicaid Expansion, with an eye towards assuring that the benefits are only going to those who truly qualify. Our tax dollars are precious. Just consider the concerns many property owners are expressing about the current increases. We need to make sure that we deliver these services efficiently and helping improve the recipients  quality of life so they no longer must depend on these services. ","I think part of the problem is that many taxes payers are unsatisfied with what they see is going on in education and are unwilling to pay more for what they see as a broken system. I have spoken to many parents who are disturbed by what they see as the promotion of alternate sexual life styles and transgenderism in our education system. Our schools need to return to their core function and that is teaching them the skills to be productive members of our society i.e.: reading, writing, history, arithmetic, science. etc.  Voters feel disenfranchised from their school boards who tend to be dominated by people from one side of the political spectrum. As long as these issues continue, funding will be difficult. "

I have hands on knowledge of how government works.  I own a small Business in Dillon and see the effect taxes and regulations have on businesses.  I have a PhD in Physics.  My education has taught me how to understand data presented to me in various forms.  My life experiences has given me common sense and taught me to listen to other persons' point of view.  By working together you often get the best end result.,I would like to keep Montana values and preserve the way of life I knew growing up in Montana.  I know that the Montana population is growing but this growth needs to be controlled so that Montana does not become another California.  I have seen a lot of changes in Montana and not all of them are positive.,Tax payers are not and should not be a bottomless purse.  Property taxes are very inequitable and discriminatory how they are calculated.  This tax must be changed if not completely removed.  Keeping high property taxes makes it so you never own your property and the Government can tax you out of your home. Finding a solution to this problem will be difficult and I am willing to work with all legislators to find a solution to this problem.,"Instead of figuring out a way to pay for high Medical and Mental health costs, Government should be looking for more cost effective methods of providing the services.  Funding is not unlimited so how to get the most for what we have has to be looked at.  Affordable health care is a problem all over the United States and what other States are doing needs to be studied.  Government has thrown tax payers money at the problem for years without looking for a way to be more cost effective.","Again as in Health care the current plan is to “find” more money for the Schools.  In reviewing my property tax a majority of the taxes are for the Schools and that is still not enough.  Ideas need to be explored on how to educate K-12 students.  I know the world has changed but we are busing children four or five blocks to school.  How much is that costing the taxpayers in equipment, fuel, and labor?  Could neighborhoods find volunteers to walk with the kids to school?  This would save some of the busing costs."

All of these experiences, along with my conservative values, will allow me to be effective in the Legislature to keep Montana heading in the right direction by advocating for a limited government that is fiscally responsable.","Property taxes are the most important thing to most people right now.  To address this we need to do several things.  First, fix the broken assessment process.  Property values have gone up but in many areas the assessed value is too high.  Also, we must keep our spending in check and keep the budget with little to no growth.  This will allow the state to drop some of the mill rates that are applied statewide.  Also, the cities are going to have to work on their budgets, this is where a lot of the property tax money is going.  There are laws that can be passed to curtail some of the rapid growth for certain parts of the population, we can put a cap on property assessment growth on certain age groups.","The property assessment process needs to be reformed.  In many cases the values were way over actual market value.  Also, once the budget is looked and and curtailed wherever possible we can lower some of the mill rates that are state wide.  Also, there can be some caps on rapid increases in market value to certain segments of the population.  For example, a retired couple that has lived in a hosue for 30 years could have a max allowable increase (on a percentage basis) per assessment period.","Since this is not a constitutionally prescribed job of the state government much of this is dependent on budget and available money.  Although the money spent on these programs usually ends up saving the state money in certain instances because it oftens falls on law enforcement.  We have almost completely eliminated state run mental facilities.  We must bring those back for the safety of people struggling with mental health issues and the safety of the communities.  In dealing with physical health, the state should promote a healthy lifestyle with incentives and credits on health care to encourage people to live healthier lives.    ",The Montana State Constitution says that the state will provide a quality public education to all students to allow them to prosper in adulthood.  I believe that our school systems are adequately funded.  Many schools have a hard time with budgeting and cannot operate withing their means.  They have a bloated payroll and are not operating an effecient school system.  Many need better management.

I served on two governor appointed State boards serving the citizens of Montana.  I served on the UM-Western Foundation Board and currently serve on the Barrett Hospital Foundation Board.  This background informs my understanding of the issues. ","Property tax reform is a top issue. There are good solutions to alleviate the recent skyrocketing taxes, including bringing back the Homestead Exemption. Support for mental health is critical. Law enforcement and educators are both impacted by the need for these services. We need to support our rural hospitals through Medicaid Expansion which is vital to the long term stability of our small hospitals and their employees. We have a looming teacher shortage that we should plan for now and we have an affordable housing crisis. We can't keep good teachers or law enforcement if they can't afford to live in our communities. Resource issues critical, such as the infringement of long held private water rights by new claimants. ","There are solutions to rising property tax. Currently,  short term rentals are subject to the same tax as residential and long-term rentals and  second homes are also taxed at the same rate as primary residences, two areas to consider. The Legislature should focus on working within the tax classes to more accurately determine who the rates are intended for. This would help achieve a fairer balance between classes. Property tax rates could be frozen; it makes little sense for someone who has owned a residence for 30 years, to be taxed on the appreciated value, when they haven't realized the gain. The tax could be changed when the residence is sold. And, spending matters. We also need to remember, each county has its own unique circumstance. ","Medicaid Expansion is essential to having a healthy work force,  it is the most cost effective way to deliver health care to those that don't have insurance, and it is supported overwhelmingly by Montanans. We need to work on a improving our mental health care system which would support law enforcement. Our jails are not designed treat mental health and our communities need services to support those that are in need. In the long term, adequate services will be more cost effective and take pressure off law enforcement and first responders. Montana's Medicaid Expansion funds major investment addressing the behavioral health crisis in our State which is critical. ",Our public education system is critical to our democracy. We have to insure school funding is adequate. The State Legislature and our Governor  have supported increases in starting teacher pay which we need.  Property taxes have already skyrocketed and homeowners aren't able to absorb the current level of tax.  A creative problem solving oriented Legislature can come up with solutions.

I am 49 and live in Big Sky, MT. I am an attorney and own my own business.  I have a B.A. in philosophy and psychology.  I graduated from the University of Montana's School of Law in 2002 with my J.D., with honors.  I specialize in contract law and litigation.

My specialty is representing owner’s associations, which is much like the legislature.  I help HOAs redraft their governing documents so that their rules actually address the needs of the community, work with government agencies on infrastructure and act as a mediator between neighbors.  I will use my skills as a drafter to draft common sense laws and as a negotiator to get them passed into law.","Property taxes and affordable housing are what people want to discuss with me.  I address property taxes in another question.

Big Sky has a resort tax, which is partially used to fund our Community Housing Trust.  Our Trust has created 52 affordable, owner-occupied condominiums, moved 111 short-term rentals into long-term, local housing, ensured seven homes will always house local workers and this summer, and will complete 25 low-income apartments for locals. The Governor’s task force identified subsidies as something that needs to be studied.  I would suggest that we should look at using the bed tax, which mainly funds advertising Montana, to go to our local communities for programs like Big Sky’s Trust. ","Over the past couple of decades, there has been a shift in the tax burden, from utilities and industries to private landowners.  While residential taxes rose 30% in Gallatin County, Montana Rail Link’s share dropped 22%.  It used to be that utilities and industry shared a larger share of the tax pie.  I believe that we have tipped the scales too much in their favor. We must move the needle back so industry can make a profit, but not on the backs of the people.","The legislature needs to permanently fund Medicaid Expansion (or as I call it, closing the coverage gap.) The Bureau of Business and Economic Research at University of Montana has consistently found that “Medicaid expansion increases health insurance coverage and healthcare access, improving individuals’ health and household’s financial health while creating thousands of jobs and millions in income for Montanans throughout the economy.”  This program provides 100,000 Montanans health insurance. That’s about 10% of our population.  It is a win win for everyone and ensures that our Federal tax dollars come home to Montana as 90% of the funding is Federal dollars.","Education funding formulas are incredibly complex and it is hard to make changes to them without unintended consequences.  However, I believe that we need to tackle this so that schools receive funding that is adjusted for median area income and cost.  Right now, there are no adjustments for the actual costs of materials, goods and for a living wage for staff.  That means a starting teacher in Miles City may be paid the same amount as one in Big Sky or West Yellowstone.  This simply is not equitable nor sustainable.  At the same time, we need to ensure that rural schools are able to use their funding in a manner that best suits them, like making funds available to build housing for their teachers."

Medicaid expansion/admin, property taxes, affordable housing, mental health, and education just to name a few. Medicaid expansion in MT sunsets in 2025, so it is imperative that the state reenrolls in that, and that we find better methods of administering access to it for Montanans that need it. We also must find more solutions to affordable housing besides reducing regulations, which many now oppose. We need to look at tax incentives for builders, developers, landlords, and towns that create truly affordable housing. I will also support sustainable solutions to finding property tax relief for many MT’s, part of which includes making sure corporations pay their share.  ","The GOP controlled state legislature and Governor failed to sustainably address the expected rise in property taxes, resulting in MT residents paying on average 21% more than they were paying. It was well known in the legislature that the short term $675 tax rebates implemented during the session were not a long term solution, and did little to relieve the cost & anxiety Montana property owners are experiencing. Certain proposals were put forth last session that did offer tax relief for MT's but were ignored. If elected I will represent the people of Montana in finding long term solutions to restructuring our property tax system, providing relief for those that need it, while ensuring the wealthy, and big corporations pay their fair share.","Medicaid Expansion in MT sunsets in 2025. It is very important that the legislature re-enrolls in that program, so as a state we can afford the costs of services available to lower-income Montanans. This is also important so that mental & healthcare providers can afford to offer their services. In 2023 after the COVID era all states had to re-align their Medicaid enrollment. In MT the Governor has administered a deeply flawed process leading to over 120,000 Montanans to lose services. Some numbers: 70,000 were due to administrative reasons, Nearly 36,000 children have had their coverage terminated, 13,000 Native folks coverage terminated, including over4,000 Native children, over 7,600 seniors kicked off their insurance. This needs fixed!","School funding is very complicated. Revenue comes from many sources: city, county, state, and federal, and is allocated in various ways. Currently the funding formula used by the state is antiquated, and limiting, and needs addressed. Whatever the case, it is duly noted that we need to invest more in our youth, and that the legislature really needs to look at the current formula, and actively find solutions. Being an educator for 30+ years this is an issue dear to my heart, and I look forward to working hard to find meaningful solutions. Describing possible solutions with a 750-character limit is impossible, however stating that I am devoted and dedicated to our educational systems and the youth they serve is easy!"

I have long been a proud Democrat.   I am a strong conservationist who believes we should wisely manage our fish and wildlife and the habitats on which they depend.  I passionately believe that both the United States and Montana should be intent on building a just and fair society and that we have the wealth and resources to ensure that every individual has adequate health care, a quality education and an equal opportunity to realize their full potential.  ","I believe that passing CI-128, which establishes a constitutional right to reproductive choice, is one of the most important issues facing Montana.  I am working hard to ensure the voters approve CI-128 in the November election.  The next legislative session must address tax fairness for property owners and continue to promote more affordable housing for both renters and homebuyers.  We must extend Medicaid so that more of our citizens have access to quality healthcare and to ensure our rural hospitals stay in business.  Protecting water quality will also be a top priority because developers will be seeking to weaken laws that protect water quality and water quantity.  ","
In the 2023 legislative session, the Republican supermajority refused to address property tax reform and as a result property taxes skyrocketed for homeowners even as they were reduced for utilities and corporations.  We must bring tax fairness back to our property tax system by creating a tax formula that ensures commercial and residential properties rise or fall proportionally with residential property taxes.  We also need additional measures in law to protect homeowners on fixed incomes. ","

Beyond cutting off the health care needed by many Montanans, ending Medicaid will severely impact many hospitals and lead to hospital closures throughout rural Montana. ","In the last two sessions, Republicans in the Legislature robbed our public schools by granting taxpayer financed tax credits to wealthy individuals making contributions to private schools.  In 2023, Republicans passed laws allowing private schools to receive public school dollars and excused these schools from any public accountability.  The Office of Public Instruction has been decimated by Republican Superintendent Elsie Arntzen.  The 2025 Legislature must prioritize strengthening our public schools and require accountability from OPI.  The Legislature must also increase starting teacher salaries so that we are competitive with other states.  Montana's beginning teacher salaries are the lowest in the nation.   "

I will introduce legislation to reform the property tax system for residences.  

What is needed is a new property tax system that limits the assessed value on primary residences.  The way this would work is a baseline property valuation will be set, based on the purchase price of the residence for the current owner, with increases in that valuation capped at a certain percentage per year.

In this way, those who have lived in their homes for a long time and who are likely on a fixed budget will not be penalized for increases in home values that do not reflect the owners' actual finances.  ",Capping assessed value as discussed in my previous answer.,Fully fund healthcare for those in need and eliminate waste in the current budget.,"Most of the problem is in waste, not in funding.  The education system struggles under the weight of special interests, excessive administration and programs that have nothing to do with the core mission of educating young people in the basics.  I'd support legislation that begins with a review of what the existing budget is being used for and then cutting those things that are extraneous, including programs that exist solely to divide people and promote special interests that detract from education (like DEI)."

My background in law prepares me to deal with the many legal issues that the legislature may consider, and especially concerning the importance of an independent judiciary. My background as a rabbi has caused some Helena insiders to dub me ""the conscience of the legislature,"" a nickname I'm proud to bear. I bring that conscience to bear on issues such as protecting 
reproductive rights, addressing the climate crisis, conservation and protecting public lands, affordable housing, accessible and affordable health care, and quality public education. ","We must extend medicaid expansion beyond its scheduled sunset. It has increased access to quality healthcare, leading to better health, employment and financial outcomes for Montanans. It brings millions of federal dollars into Montana, keeps our rural hospitals afloat, and creates many good paying Montana jobs. It helps children receive consistent healthcare so that problems are discovered and treated early, and it improves school readiness. It saves money by reducing emergency room visits, leaving emergency rooms available to those in acute need. I have continually fought for accessible health care for working Montanans, such as HB850 which I sponsored last session to boost medicaid coverage for Montana children.","We must restore property tax fairness for Montana homeowners. Last session, the Republican supermajority's policies and subsequent action by the Governor caused  property taxes to skyrocket, while taxes for corporations, mines, utilities, and the wealthiest Montanans decreased. I introduced HB253 which sought to prevent these extreme increases by allowing state mills to ""float,"" so that when property values increase, mills decrease and tax bills remain relatively constant. My bill also sought to create a homestead exemption for those living in their homes, shifting the burden back to corporations and second home owners. I also supported other similar Democratic proposals. I will continue to fight for property tax fairness for homeowners. ","The most critical action needed is extending medicaid expansion. We must also address Republican policies which have stripped 120,000 Montanans of their health care, including 30,000 children, mostly for technical red tape reasons. To prevent this in the future, I will seek to restore ""continuous eligibility"" which was Montana policy until the Governor ended it. I sought to create continuous eligibility for children last session, which failed by one vote, so I will try again. I also introduced HB17, which sought to create Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, to greatly expand access to mental health care. That policy is going forward and we will hopefully see results in the not too distant future.  ","I am a strong supporter of public schools and our universities. We must end the Republican policies of siphoning money from our public schools to unaccountable private and religious schools. We must increase teacher pay so that we are no longer 50 of 50 states in teacher pay. We must revise the caps which now limit increases so that they don't keep up with inflation. We must allocate more state funds to our public schools and universities, in lieu of Republican tax breaks for the wealthiest Montanans."

Medicaid Expansion must be reauthorized and revised to ensure DPHHS doesn't continue to kick thousands of Montanans off their healthcare.

","Housing -  we must increase the supply of affordable and sustainable housing. Taxing out-of-state second-home owners at a higher rate than single-owner in-state residents can be utilized to fund these activities and reduce the burden on residents. Additionally, I support repealing the ban on inclusionary zoning that was passed in 2021.  

Energy policy -  Montana stands to profit handsomely from confronting climate change. We have incredible renewable energy resources. We need legislative leadership to enact policies to hasten and facilitate the renewable energy bonanza  in Montana. 

Fairer taxation -  I support relying more on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund.

Other pressing issues below.","Property taxes are inherently complex and administratively troublesome.  They also vary wildly based on boom-bust cycles in property markets and assessed values.  Relying on income taxes as a larger source of overall funding for the state general fund reduces uncertainty and can be easily structured to be fairer.  I support creating additional income tax brackets for those making over approximately $125,000 to offset lowering the property rate for in-state primary residence homeowners.  I also support creating a separate increased rate for out-of-state property owners, and taxing corporate and industrial property owners to levels somewhere between 1994 and now.","We need to ensure our residents’ ability to obtain Medicaid and Medicare is as easy as possible.   Montana should expand Medicaid coverage and ensure continuous coverage until re-enrollment eligibility processes are completed by the state.  To that end, we need to make certain we have a fully staffed and funded Department of Public Health and Human Services to handle the administrative burdens placed upon it.

Further, let’s guarantee our rural residents have access to timely and high quality healthcare.  Montana should increase our Medicaid reimbursement rates to help keep rural facilities open.  ","We must eliminate the current 3% cap on inflationary spending for education.  We should, at minimum, use the actual inflation rate as the spending increase limit.  And, quite frankly, this states’ most important investment is our children and their education; artificial limits on that investment are short-sighted.
Further, we have the lowest starting salary for teachers of any state in the nation.  Embarrassing.  Given Montana’s cost of living, particularly housing, we should have some of the nation’s highest starting salaries our educators.

I am a retired educator with an BA in Elementary Education and a MA in Education. Growing up on a ranch in the foothills of the Beartooth Mountains, my dad instilled in me a strong work ethic. He always said, “If there is a job, just do it!” My rural upbringing, my years as an educator, parenting and advocating  for environmental, social and education issues has helped me prepare to serve in the Montana State Legislature. These experiences have served me well the past three terms. I show up, advocate for my constituents and work collaboratively. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve Montana and do this important work. ","There are many pressing issues. Housing, tax reform, and reauthorizing Medicaid Expansion are three big issues to consider as we prepare for the 2025 legislature. I will support affordable and accessible housing reform, I will work towards a fair and equitable tax policy, and I will vote for the continuation of the expansion of Medicaid. As a member of the Education Budget Sub Committee, I will work towards providing a budget that addresses inflation  to the agencies we oversee, and I will advocate for crucial programs within these specific agencies to make certain they remain and are secure. As we navigate budgetary decisions,  I will support adequate funding for government services including public education, health, and corrections. ","During the 2025 legislative session, the legislature will have an opportunity to design an equitable tax policy. Over the past decades and most recently with dramatically increasing home valuations, the tax burden has unfairly shifted to Montana’s residential property taxpayers and other taxpayers with low and moderate incomes. Opportunities include a special option sales tax, tax credits for qualifying families, consideration of a  homestead exemption, and carefully analyzing  residential property reappraisals. As lawmakers, we need to create equitable property tax classifications, we need to eliminate income tax reductions, and we must create a top income tax bracket to shift some tax responsibility to the wealthy. 
","Montana expanded Medicaid is scheduled to sunset in 2025 unless the State Legislature reauthorizes it in the upcoming session. As of June 2023, 328,538 Montana citizens were enrolled in Montana Medicaid.  Medicaid Expansion has kept health care accessible for all Montanans including children,  covers preventive services to identify health issues early,  provides needed behavioral health services and ultimately has kept people working. The state budget benefits with the federal government providing approximately $900 million into Montana annually. Medicaid strengthens the health care sector, keeps services available in urban and rural Montana communities, and supports new economic activity. 
 ","The state’s existing school funding formula isn’t keeping up with the costs of educating students due to inflation and declines in enrollment. The Decennial Study of school funding  will occur in the interim after the 2025 legislature and will assess the educational needs and costs related to the basic system and make recommendations to the 2027 legislature.  This  delays needed support that our school districts would benefit from  sooner than later. In 2025,  I will work with educational leaders across the state as we navigate the proposed budgets for opportunities to enhance funding at all levels of the Montana Education system by working to remove or increasing the inflationary cap and by keeping public dollars in our public schools.

As a scientist I can explain situations to diverse groups of people and help use facts and data to drive decisions based on our shared Montana values. I was raised in a rural, agricultural community that gave me an appreciation and love for our Montana lands.

We must provide additional tax credits to match federal ones to make building affordable units pencil out. We can also create a housing trust to allow more investment in local community efforts.
Women’s healthcare must be protected.  
The decennial study of education funding is coming in the 2025-2026 interim. The configuration of that study, crafting the desperately needed changes for rural and urban school districts in the 2027 session, will be a critical project of the 2025 Legislature.

",Property Taxes will be addressed in the next session. Increasing the homestead exemption for low-income Montanans and using income tax to reduce the property tax obligation on low-income Montanans will provide help to those that need it the most. Increasing school funding from the state level will relieve some pressure locally. Allowing for SB442 to relieve burdens of road maintenance will also help reduce any increases locally. ,"The legislature needs to step in and maintain the Medicaid program in DPHHS that was purposefully undermined.  Upwards of 100,000 Montanans have been kicked off. The Governor paid $2m for a contractor to make recommendations to improve the workplace at the State Hospital. Very few recommendations have been implemented to improve the situation.  DPHHS has not been paying local community healthcare providers for both healthcare and mental health services already provided, delaying the payments so community providers are being forced to close their doors.  Protecting these community-based services should be a top priority for the legislature. We have worked for years to place services in local areas to improve access and need to keep them.","The Montana Legislature must increase state funding of schools and address the needs of both rural and urban schools in the new funding formula. The percent of state funding of schools has gone down over the last many years which requires local mill levies to increase dramatically just to maintain current levels of programs. Investing in a sustainable funding mechanism will allow schools to provide quality educational experiences to kids all over Montana. We also need to pay our teachers better, keeping our Montana educated teachers here rather than losing them to other states. A statewide teacher salary schedule could address this issue."

I also serve my hometown of East Helena as a council member, with a focus on responsible economic development, strong and community-driven law enforcement, and city growth that doesn't force costs on current residents.","Property tax reform is the most pressing issue facing Montnanans. I would propose or support a long term solution to balance the method in which mills are determined and ensure that if a surplus occurs due to property tax revenue, the money is returned to all property owners. We also need to address Montana second homes and short term rentals and at what rate those property taxes are collected.","To address this issue, I have noted possible solutions steps above. Additionally, the Legislature needs to redetermine school funding mechanisms and take into consideration technology and safety/security needs that are ever changing. Local municipalities also need to find ways to be more fiscally conservative to utilize local taxes more responsibly. I am proud of how, in recent years, the East Helena budget is determined and executed with residents' concerns and best interests in mind to stretch every dollar as far as possible.  ","There are numerous programs and funding sources currently available that can better collaborate, cost-share, and cross fund. Streamlining services needs to be a priority. I proudly served on the State Rehabilitation Council that provided insight and guidance to the state and federal funding sources to help those with disabilities find and secure educational and workforce development programs that fit their long-term needs for independent living. The Voc Rehab programs are great examples of collaborative and life changing assistance with strong and measurable goals and outcomes. When publicly available programs creatively find ways to braid funding resources and utilize other existing programs they are much more successful for those in need.","The legislature can ensure that all families and students have adequate funding by focusing on schools, districts, teachers, and programs with strong outcomes and not rewarding those with weak and low performing outcomes. Additionally, the funding formula should take into account rapidly changing programs like Career and Technical Education (CTE), technology in the classroom and schools, and school safety and security.

I propose legislation to support law enforcement and expand mental health services, ensuring our communities are safe and nurturing. 

Additionally, I will champion policies that safeguard Montana's cultural heritage and beautiful landscapes, promoting sustainable growth that respects our traditions. These initiatives are vital for maintaining our quality of life and ensuring Montana remains a welcoming and vibrant place for all families.","Addressing rising residential property taxes is crucial. I support reviewing and refining our property tax system, including necessary revisions to the homestead exemption to reduce the property tax burden for full time Montana residents and homeowners. 

Importantly, I am completely opposed to introducing any sales tax in Montana, as it contradicts our state’s fiscal principles. Instead, I advocate for more efficient use of existing resources and exploring alternative revenue measures that do not increase financial strain on Montana families. This approach ensures essential services are maintained without compromising our economic values.","To enhance healthcare access, the Legislature should focus on establishing regional psychiatric care centers to provide specialized support, replacing the Montana State Hospital system. This initiative would specifically target mental health services, ensuring those most in need receive appropriate care. Additionally, we must expand rural health services and telemedicine for physical health care, improving accessibility for all Montanans, regardless of location. By improving the efficiency of health programs and fostering partnerships with non-profits, we can enhance service delivery and manage costs effectively. Prioritizing these areas ensures comprehensive health support, promoting overall well-being across the state.","To ensure our young students and future workforce are well-prepared, I support revising our state's school funding formula to better meet the needs of K-12 education and vocational training programs. This adjustment would focus on enhancing resources for skills-based education, particularly for older youth and young adults, ensuring they gain practical and valuable skills for today’s job market. By investing in these areas, we’re not only supporting academic achievement but also providing vital career pathways that strengthen our communities and boost economic growth. Adequate, sustainable funding for these educational sectors is essential for the long-term prosperity of our state."

Permanent resident of Bozeman, MT. Just retired from teaching in the Bozeman Public Schools after 28 years. BA from Occidental College. M. Ed. from Lesley University. 

If you can be successful in the public schools, arguably the most high-stakes, unpredictable, emotionally charged, and demanding work environments in the valley, then you are well-situated to succeed on the rollercoaster that is the current MT legislature. To go further, my work experience gives me intimate familiarity with the kinds of challenges facing Bozeman residents and especially families.
","Fair Taxation: The corporate tax burden has been lessened at the expense of  home owners. This must be remedied.
Housing: While there is insufficient room to spell out the details here, we must use creativity and ambition with the levers of government to support and create housing that is affordable.
Education: For generations, public schools have been the engines of Montana communities. But funding has slipped over time, and without renewed investment, our children’s futures are at risk. To begin with, we cannot continue as the lowest paying state in the nation in terms of salaries for new teachers.
Energy: We must ensure reasonably priced, responsibly-sourced energy production. This requires confronting Northwestern Energy.","1. We must rebalance the tax load such that corporations pay their fair share. Residential property valuations have jumped, but other kinds of property valuations have declined. Usually, there is an attempt to balance all this out, but during the last session, this did not happen. We must rebalance such that big business doesn’t get cuts at our expense. 
2. We have a significant surplus at the moment. Let’s put aside some of it specifically to serve schools. The interest would make a real difference in terms of maintaining programs and paying teachers.
3. Localities should be allowed more room for taxing tourists. Costs in Bozeman, for instance, are astronomical. Taxing tourists means paying employees more reasonable wages.
","It is paramount that we do everything possible to take advantage of Medicaid. For the most part, this program is paid for by the federal government, and yet our leaders have recently worked to cut off this resource? According to The Daily Montanan, an astounding 127,000 Montanans, many of whom are children, were recently cut off from Medicaid. That is, they were cut off from medical support. This is the opposite of enhancing healthcare access for lower-income Montanans. If we care about Montanans, we must reverse course.


","I answered this question partially in number three. But here is more:

The legislature uses a funding formula that provides schools with funding based on 3% inflationary increases per year. But the actual inflation rate has been much higher. For example, in 2022, it was 8%. In 2023, it was 4.1%. Over time, this discrepancy means shrinking support for our schools, shrinking support that compounds. We need to have our funding relate to actual on-the-ground cost increases. 

Also, the school funding formula doesn’t adjust for cost of living challenges. Teachers need more money to live in Bozeman than they need in small rural communities, for instance. We need to find a way to adjust funding for schools according to cost of living.

Furthermore, I advocate for broader Medicaid eligibility, consumer protections, and reduced prescription costs to ensure comprehensive healthcare. Let's unite to enact bold policies for a brighter future.","
I recognize the strain of escalating residential property taxes, especially for fixed-income families and seniors in Montana. While vital for funding local services, our tax system must be fair. Our current regressive property tax system disproportionately affects working families. I propose shifting the tax burden from residential homeowners by increasing taxes on other property classifications. This would bolster the local economy, benefiting all Montanans. Fairness demands everyone contributes equitably to uphold our beloved state and its essential services.","I'm committed to tackling the critical issues facing Montanans, starting with accessible healthcare. No one should forego medical care due to financial constraints. I'll push for policies ensuring quality healthcare for all, regardless of income. Extending Medicaid beyond 2025 is crucial, especially for vulnerable populations like children. We must address healthcare access disparities by investing in preventive care, telehealth, and rural healthcare. Healthcare is a basic right, and I'll tirelessly advocate for its accessibility to every Montanan, building a system that uplifts our communities.","I'm deeply dedicated to ensuring every child in Montana receives a top-notch education, from pre-K through college. Our current school funding formula falls short, hindering schools from keeping up with rising costs.

The private, free market should be protected and encouraged to offer competitive health insurance options to all socioeconomic classes in Montana.  If any laws are to be passed to enhance health care access, it would be to protect individuals who use cost sharing health co ops (instead of  insurance monopolies) from abuses.   ","The state should not be raising our kids, period.  I am a public school teacher and I can tell you from real world experience, throwing more money at our problems in education is not going to solve anything.  We need a cultural shift in our country.  We need to take ownership of our families (I have two boys, ages 3 and 1.5) and raise them to love the Lord with all their hearts, souls, minds and strength, and to love their neighbors as themselves.  We need to encourage active participation of school board elections and meetings, and we need to make sure that our tax dollars follow the child, no matter if that is to a public school, charter school, or homeschool.  There does not need to be any increases in public school funding.      "

I attended college at Montana State University in Bozeman, and have lived in Bozeman and am now raising my family here for 26 years. I am the executive director of a conservation nonprofit called the Mountain Mamas, who focus on elevating women's voices regarding conservation issues. I also co-own a marketing firm that assists in communications efforts for entities like the City of Bozeman, Headwaters Economics, Madison Valley Bank, United States Forest Service, and many more. For many years, I was a mountaineering guide, and traveled the world extensively climbing and skiing. For the past 15 years, I've devoted my career to influencing federal and state legislation.","SB442 and the voter-supported and driven efforts to provide conservation financing to the state is very top of mind for myself. Gov. Gianforte is ignoring the will of the voters, and that must be rectified. Additionally, threats and targeted legislation that would alter or change our Montana constitution - especially women's ability to care for our bodies as we see fit - are very concerning. Stomping down efforts and proposed legislation that would compromise women's access to healthcare must be stopped, and I would absolutely support any legislation that would permanently support a woman's right to choose and provide an insurance policy to our state constitution. Additionally, we must fund, support, and protect our public schools.","The increase in property taxes has effected nearly every homeowner in Montana, apparently except for Gov. Gianforte. we must find relief, and explore other areas of taxation to support essential services. I would propose steeper taxes on second and third homeowners, as well as ensure large businesses are paying their fair share. Additionally, some sales tax options on an individual city or county scale basis could be explored, perhaps for non-essential items (so excluding food, healthcare items, etc.) Asking residential homeowners to bear the brunt of the tax burden is simple not fair, or tenable for hard-working Montanans.","The cuts to Medicare this fall were heartbreaking. Medicare expansion is vital to help support ALL Montanans, especially those that fall in the cracks of the income brackets in the Health Care Marketplace. The legislature MUST expand healthcare access for all, and especially provide comprehensive mental health support and access. I was able to tour the Community Health Partners site in Bozeman, and was blown away with the mental, dental, and physical health services they provide. These facilities are needed in more places across Montana, and we must work to help fund efforts to grow access to quality care, at a low-to-free cost. ","As a recipient of a quality public school education, and as a daughter of two public school educators, a sister-in-law to a public school administrator, and mother of three daughters who are currently receiving a public school education, I see how hard our educators work over the years and struggle to find enough funding to pay teachers a living wage, pay for books and needed supplies, and maintain school playgrounds, ball fields, and facilities. We MUST invest in our public schools, and the teachers, administrators, and support staff that educate the coming generations. We must study and identify opportunities to expand public school funding and support. "

As a practicing attorney for 40 years I am well prepared to deal with legislation and complex legal issues, especially in the area of taxation as I am a tax attorney.

I have a long record of public service in the areas of seniors, public health, transportation, government (co-wrote the city charter), planning, and parks.  I am well versed in the many issues I will face as a legislator.","Property tax reform.  The current system is unconscionable.  We need to reduce the overall tax rate, require MDOR to equalize properties as required by law, and provide additional relief for people on fixed incomes.

Affordable Housing.  The housing authority statute needs to be modernized (it was written in 1935) and additional government solutions to housing in support of local government need to be devised.  The current market centric solutions are not working

Medicaid Renewal is a must, as it stabilizes rural hospitals,  enhances employment, reduces overall health care costs, and   is a good deal for the state

We need to re-pass, and overide a veto if necessary, legislation making it easier for seniors to stay in their homes.  ","First, there is still $1 billion of unallocated surplus.  The tax burden on individual taxpayers need to be shifted back to corporate taxpayers.  In 1993 the burden was 38%, now it is 58% and the corporate burden has been reduced.  NWE needs to pay more and you and me less.

That said, the simplest solution would be to reduce the overall tax rates as MDOR proposed in 2022.  Further, we need to look at providing additional relief to people on fixed incomes.","DPHHS is a mess.  Additional funding may be needed to coordinate all the various health programs adminsistered by the state.

I know this has been a topic of one of the interim committees.

Eligibility for Mediciad Expansion in the reauthorization should be as liberal as CMS will allow.

Funding for substance abuse and mental health should be increased.

Local medicaid providers should be reimbursed for the additional costs they incurred because of the mismanaged Medicaid review ","We need a corporate surtax dedicated to all levels of education, restoring the balance that existed 30 years ago.  This is a problem 30 years in the making.  The top tax rate on individuals also needs to be increased."

Regulation must be carefully crafted to nurture healthy work environments.",Federal encroachment on personal and state freedoms must be addressed. States must reclaim their proper functions and limit federal overreach. State law needs to be more explicit in remedies such as recall guidelines and bonding requirements for when our elected officials act outside of their enumerated powers or fail to fulfill their duties of office. Transparency in the law-making process and financial expenditures is needed to illuminate wasteful spending; mandated online annual reporting is needed. Property tax increases need to be capped to no more than 10% in any one year and property tax relief given to the elderly on fixed incomes.,"Taxation should never be separated from expenditures. Every school and state department should post online their current request for funding, their current funding sources and amounts and their past three years of expenditures. Each department should have a published statement on what their main function is; expenditures outside of the main focus would then become obvious as financials are also published. A state-funded task force of business experts could be utilized to help each department or school district find efficiencies through technology or innovative restructuring. ",The current health-care system in America is broken and in need of critical scrutiny. The unhealthy monetization of disease treatments needs to be abolished. Freedom to choose medical care should be enhanced and barriers to innovative healthcare delivery removed such as obstacles to subscription services by family doctors. Fraud in the Medicare system needs to be aggressively prosecuted as well as price gouging by pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies. The best outcome for health delivery is to remove third parties that stand between the health care provider and the patient.   ,"Education delivery has not kept up with technology and needs to be rethought. Parents consistently support more choice in education opportunities such as homeschooling, private schools, charter schools, vocational and public schools. Public schools may better serve as education centers that parents can choose what their child needs from a variety of services. Better use of current facilities to serve growing student population should be considered. Allowing for schools to hire teachers from professional backgrounds without teaching certificates would help alleviate teacher shortages. Efficiencies may be gained by regulatory relief on required administrative positions. "

I attended Montana State University and graduated in 2021 with degrees in sociology and political science. I currently work at several local restaurants and am a community organizer in local Democratic politics, activating and mobilizing our community. 
I know firsthand the challenges so many in our community face. I am 24 and trying to keep my roots in the Bozeman community. I have already navigated the diverse range of opinions and experiences in Montana politics to make decisions to strengthen grassroots networks. As a legislator, I will make policy decisions based on the needs and experiences of my constituents, voting with integrity to promote community and sustainability.","We must ensure that our community continues to be liveable for the residents as it grows. Many people are concerned about affordability, especially housing and healthcare costs. Residents want sustainable development that doesn't unnecessarily strain our environment and natural resources. Access to quality public education from pre-k to college is also challenging for many.
I support solutions including equalizing property tax rates to alleviate unnecessary financial burdens, voting to renew Medicaid expansion without a sunset date, making policy decisions that respect and protect our constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, and providing adequate funding to our public school districts to support future generations.","The state has the constitutional responsibility to “appraise, assess, and equalize the valuation of all property” (Article VIII, Sect. 3). Property taxes skyrocketed because values spiked, but the tax rates weren’t equalized during the 2023 legislative session. Since the property values increased and tax rates stayed the same, tax bills increased dramatically. I would support re-equalizing property tax rates to rebalance how much homeowners are charged without reducing the revenue collected by the state. Additionally, it is important for the state to consider the needs of the communities and factors like the cost of living when distributing funding to schools and local governments.","Before considering additional steps, we need to ensure that the state maintains the current support for lower-income Montanans by renewing Medicaid expansion, which is scheduled to sunset in 2025. The legislature should remove the sunset from Medicaid expansion because it is a program that has proven to bolster local economies, support healthcare providers, and keep Montanans healthier than they would be without it. Additionally, our state needs to ensure that Medicaid adequately reimburses providers for the services provided so that providers can stay open. Continued investment in our healthcare system that allows for accessible meaningful mental and physical healthcare services is essential.","Education leaders are correct. The current cap on annual inflationary increases is lower than the inflation rate. I support adjusting the funding formula to keep up with inflation and ensuring that our teachers receive competitive wages that allow them to live in the communities where they teach. 
Public education is not just a policy issue for me-it's personal. I wouldn't have had the opportunities I've had in life without the public education system in our state. I am dedicated to supporting policies that guarantee public funding is directed towards public schools, that families can access affordable early childhood education, and that post-secondary education remains accessible to residents while supporting a sustainable labor force."

Agriculture is important to Montana. As a rancher in Western Montana, I understand the challenges that farmers and ranchers face across the state.  As a successful businessman, I also understand the issues that small businesses, property, and homeowners across the state face.  As a school bus contractor for over 30 years, I am familiar with Montana’s public school system.  All these experiences will be valuable as the legislature tackles decisions about agriculture, taxes, wildlife, and the economy.   ","There are many issues facing Montana, but two of the top issues that I hear from Montanans are:  1) Rapid Increase in Cost of Living.  Young Montanans must move out of state to find good paying jobs and affordable homes, as people with high salaries and large retirement accounts from the East Coast, West Coast, and big cities (who can work from anywhere) are buying up properties and driving up home and land prices in the state.  Many small businesses are losing their employees, in part, because those workers cannot afford housing in some regions of Montana.  
 I would propose tax breaks and waiving of building permit fees to businessmen who build housing units for their employees.  

2)Rising Taxes. See answer to question #3. 
","Reduced spending and tax cuts should be considered.  State and counties must evaluate  what services are truly essential.
State government is primarily funded by income tax collections.  With more workers, there is more revenue collected.  I do not support increasing Montana’s income tax, but rather, place less tax burden and regulation on businesses.  When business owners spend less time on government red tape, they have more  resources to expanding & improving business, leading to more job opportunities = more workers, more tax base.
The legislature should consider a tax on the purchase of luxury items .  Note, I DO NOT SUPPORT SALES TAX on everyday essential items.   
","To care for those individuals whose cannot function in society and have nowhere to go but the streets, I recommend that the state look into providing support to mental health facilities that can house and care for these individuals. ","We need to evaluate where education money is being spent and on what curriculums and tasks teachers are spending their time.  Emphasis should be on teaching fundamentals - English, writing skills, math and science skills, life skills (i.e. balancing a checkbook, managing money).    "

I moved to the Helena area in 1999 and to the East Helena area in 2005. I moved to Helena to take a job with the Montana Department of Revenue where I worked as the Department's primary property tax attorney until 2017. I interpreted existing laws, worked with the Legislature to draft proposed laws, and worked with stakeholders to improve Montana's property tax system. I became the Department's Chief Administrative Law Judge in 2017 where I heard and ruled on challenges brought against the Department by taxpayers. I retired in 2023. As a property ax expert I am uniquely qualified to help fix the current problems with our tax system.","My primary goal is to lessen the tax burden on homeowners and Main Street business owners and would support legislation to do that. I will also work to ensure continued access to public lands for recreational purposes, and to increase access where possible. Access to housing and healthcare must be addressed, as many Montanans cannot afford either. I would support legislation to address these issues. I am also verry concerned with government overreach, the lack of transparency in government, and the need for fiscal responsibility. I would support legislation to address these issues.","Montana’s property taxes are out of hand. Owners of residential property and Main Street business bear an excessive tax burden under the current system, and something needs to be done. However, it’s imperative we fund our local programs and schools. Current laws relating to the calculation of school mills need to be revisited. As a member of the Legislature, I would support a review of historic school financing needs, and work with school leaders, parents, and local governments to determine likely future needs. Once the scope of need is established, I would support legislation that would attempt to fund those needs by requiring corporations and non-resident property owners to bear a fair portion of our residents' property tax liabilities.","Untreated physical and mental health issues of our citizens have significant social and economic impacts on all Montanans. Access to proper health care reduces the overall cost to state and local governments by assisting individuals in becoming more engaged and productive members of their communities. The Legislature should strive to better serve its rural communities through programs designed to establish clinics, mobile health care, and telehealth providers in our rural areas.  Our lawmakers should also work to expand services currently provided to low-income and at-risk citizens, and to develop a more workable process for determining and redetermining Medicaid eligibility.","Montana’s Constitutional goal is to establish an education system that will “develop the full educational potential of each person” and to fund the State’s share of that system in an equitable manner. Montana’s school funding process is complex, and I would work with experts from across the state to determine whether that funding process is viable or if new or additional funding is required. The Legislature’s first goal should be to support its public school system rather than to divert tax dollars to privatize education. Montana’s future is in the hands of our children and young adults, and I believe it is imperative that we provide adequate educational opportunities to ensure they become effective stewards of that future."

I am very optimistic that the Governor's Property Tax Task Force will be able to identify various problems our communities face with budget needs and be able to provide solutions and relief to the fixed and low income, elderly and disabled Montana Veterans.","The system is set by Legislature but the system is created with input from many stakeholders.  It has been many years since the manner in which property taxes are calculated, has seen significant reform. 
I've lived in Montana all of my life and I believe during the last 7-10 years, our landscape, houses and rural lands has changed the most drastically. Due to increased demand to live in the 406 area code, real estate prices have driven up values and market values are what drive the equation.  It is time to change the equation. It is past time to change the equation. Voters in my district were hurting before the market drove up the property taxes. In 2023 session, we increased funds for tax relief and expanded eligibility for the programs. ","In my three sessions, I feel as if we have gained ground each session in addressing the needs of those needing mental and physical health care services. Is it ever ""enough"" ? Unfortunately no, but the Legislature will continue work on this issue, as we do all others. In 2015, the Legislature passed the HELP Act (Medicaid Expansion), and in 2019, passed the continuation of Medicaid Expansion.  It will be on the Agenda again this session. The big push will be to either renew or delete the sunset. Also added in 2019 were work requirements and other measures to help prevent fraud. I think Medicaid Expansion does allow lower-income people to receive health care access.",

Our ability to make personal health care decisions is under attack.  I will defend the Right to Privacy as afforded to us by the Montana Constitution.
The influx of out of state residences has inflated housing costs beyond the means of average Montanans.  Affordable Housing is a legislative priority.  I propose incentives for affordable housing projects and employer sponsored housing.  I also propose fees on new construction assessed proportional to the value with such fees supporting incentives and subsidies","I would propose a review of small acreage parcels claiming agricultural exemptions.

Expansion of health coverage, whether public or private, to include mental health services is critical for mitigation and prevention of accompanying issues, addiction, partner or child abuse, and a host of personal and community risks.
I believe that health care is a human right, and although I support a single payer health care plan not tied to employment, that is an issue for the US Congress.  Whatever can be done to promote the health of Montanans and assure the reliability and affordability of health care access is an important, if not the most important, priority for government leaders.","The school funding formulas must include allowances for personnel cost of living increases and service costs such as fuel and facility maintenance., and proposals for adjustment should be considered and adopted.

All of these experience","Medicaid expansion is one, since it will go away without action from the state legislature. I will support continuing Medicaid expansion.
Access to reproductive health care is another, since our current state administration is committed to outlawing not just abortion, but fertility treatments and birth control. I will always vote in support of a women’s right to control their own body, health care and family planning.

Housing is another pressing issue, and I think the government can play a role in making housing more affordable. Solutions range from zoning changes to subsidizing or underwriting affordable housing projects with loans, grants or other incentives. It is clear that “the market” is not going to correct itself any time soon.
","A lot of our property taxes go towards local roads and schools. The state could help alleviate property taxes by paying more of the cost for local schools and roads. Most people had their property taxes increased this year due to the GOP administration failing to reduce that tax rate (despite their own Department of Revenue advising them to do so). Yet our local schools are still struggling, resulting in an emergency for local taxpayers.

Another example of the state not listening to local taxpayers is when Missoula County adopted, by popular vote, a local 2 cent gas tax, as a way to alleviate pro",We clearly need to continue Medicaid Expansion and increase provider rates so that health professionals can offer needed services.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts, and I've completed the equivalent to a Bachelor's in Science in Psychology from Montana State University Bozeman. I worked as a Care Manager at Youth Dynamics and as the Director of Operations for a large spa company. I have skills in navigating difficult conversations, finding people's needs, and collaborating on meaningful solutions. Short on time, I prioritize tasks to advance my goals while also tending to the day-to-day needs of my kids. I work well under pressure and am committed to serving the greater good, particularly for marginalized and underrepresented groups.","Montana's democracy and personal freedoms are being attacked by a powerful few. I will fight for policies protecting our rights regarding medical privacy, bodily autonomy and worker's union rights. Our current property tax system unconstitutionally burdens lower income Montanans, and I propose shifting this burden back to the ultra-wealthy and large corporations. Additionally, I'll advocate for the enhancement of Medicaid, which supports low and middle income Montanans, including many indigenous people and children, and helps our rural economies with jobs in health care. Our public schools also need proper funding and fair teacher salaries; I am committed to fully supporting them and resisting the shift of funds to private charter schools.","Our Montana property tax system has become increasingly and unconstitutionally hard on low-to-middle-income Montana residents while providing tax cuts to large corporations and the ultra-rich. The solution is straightforward: shift the tax burden back to the groups with the largest amount of resources and influence. Currently, residential properties are taxed based on market value, whereas industrial properties owned by refineries, railroads, and telecom companies are assessed differently. This discrepancy unfairly benefits these corporations, allowing them to contribute less than their fair share. Adjusting this imbalance will make the tax system more equitable, and replenish our state fund which supports essential services for Montanans.","Medicaid expansion, 90% funded by the federal government, has helped rural Montana hospitals and care facilities stay open through recent economic and pandemic related setbacks. We have invested in the expansion of services due to the cost savings and bolstered our economy with good paying jobs around the state. Medicaid expansion will end in 2025 unless our elected officials renew it. We need more long-term care facilities for mental health and the aging community through additional expenditures, which are made possible by the consistent annual influx of over $900million in federal funds. Patients benefit from remaining close to their families and communities, and our aging population will be needing a lot more care in the coming decades.","The funding challenges are connected to the shift of the tax burden from large corporations and the ultra-rich to workers and families who simply have less money to pull from. This has had a direct impact on resources available to fund schools. We must realign the tax system to ensure fairness. Additionally, removing the 3% cap on inflationary budget increases is crucial. This allows budget adjustments to accurately reflect actual inflation rates, which were as high as 8% in recent years. Furthermore, there's a pressing need to increase state funding for special education programs, and to stop the steal of school funding by siphoning money to private charter schools who are not required to educate students needing specific interventions."

","2)	Unfortunately, the 2023 super majority failed to address any long-term solutions for affordable housing, even with a $2 billion dollar surplus, so this remains a concerning issue. However, Medicaid expansion is undoubtedly the most pressing issue heading into the 2025 session. Medicaid expansion keeps Montanans healthy & working especially those working in jobs which are critical to the economy such as childcare or other service sector jobs. I support legislation that lifts the sunset on Medicaid expansion & would also support permanently removing the sunset.  Expansion keeps the doors open on our rural hospitals and keeps the uncompensated care costs down.  Medicaid expansion improves healthcare for all Montanans.","3)	A once-in-a-generation opportunity to fully invest in a better, affordable Montana for all was wasted when the legislature chose to prioritize significant tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent, and chose to dish out multiple one-time rebates instead of utilizing the historic surplus towards any type of long-term policy solutions. Families with the lowest incomes are paying a greater share of their income in State and Local taxes, and residential taxpayers (ie, homeowners and renters) are paying a greater share of property taxes. I support legislation that will reduce property taxes for those whose property taxes exceed a percentage of their incomes and require corporations and those with higher incomes to pay their fair share of taxes.","First & foremost, pass Medicaid expansion. The federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion; the state pays the remaining 10%. Expansion improves heath care access for all Montanans by providing more options for mental health & substance abuse treatments, increases services offered at Indian Health Service facilities and provides greater access to preventive care & early screenings which lead to healthier and better lives. Expansion brings in millions in new federal spending creating jobs, helps maintain a healthy workforce & promotes economic growth.","5)	A strong public education system not only benefits the individual student but plays a crucial role in the development of an informed and engaged citizenry.  Quality public education ensures that individuals have the tools to learn, adapt and thrive throughout their lives and strengthens communities by fostering collaboration and shared responsibility.  The State needs to focus on investing more resources and money into our public education systems rather than diverting public funds to support private schools.  The school funding formula is complex and does not adequately fund larger school districts.  I support looking at ways to improve the school funding formula to address this funding gap."

Before I became a mom, I worked with families in crisis. That work is about cooperating, communicating effectively, and building action plans in stressful situations. As a new parent, I’ve learned to keep my eye on the bigger picture and what to prioritize. I’ve also deepened my ability to hold boundaries during emotionally charged moments. For three sessions I’ve served in the Montana Legislature, most recently on the Appropriations Committee. My experience has taught me how to get things done and hold the line for Montana values. ","Housing in Montana is so unaffordable and hard to come by that we must utilize every tool to make renting and buying a home possible. I am in favor of almost any tax credits and subsidies, especially those that go directly to the resident. The last legislature made progress in increasing the number of living units available, but now it’s time to work on making sure Montanans can afford what is available. The Legislature also needs to continue to protect the rights of mobile home owners against out-of-state corporations intent on pricing them out of their communities.","During the legislature, the Governor and Republican supermajority could have acted on the advice of the Department of Revenue and adjusted the property tax rate to account for the recent increases in property values. Instead, they frittered time away giving tax breaks to the wealthy and big businesses.

Big property tax payers – like big corporations, owners of railroads and mines – have a cap on how much their property taxes can increase, but homeowners do not. We have to enact long-term property tax relief plans that protect middle class Montanans from footing the bill that gives big corporations a tax break.","Everyone deserves healthcare, no exceptions. Being able to maintain your health is part of living a free and satisfying life. Many people in our communities are struggling with chronic disease or addiction and can’t afford care. The legislature must continue Medicaid expansion past 2025. Medicaid expansion is a great deal for Montana. It has been a crucial tool for helping many of our friends and neighbors get or stay healthy enough to work or get an education. Medicaid expansion has created good paying jobs across the state, helped keep healthcare accessible in rural Montana, and it costs the state pennies on the dollar to maintain.",One of the most valuable investments that we can make is in the education of our children. Having an educated community increases public safety and improves the quality of our workforce. I am in favor of improving our school spending formula to increase the funding available for schools. I oppose any measures that divert money away from public schools. I also would strongly support increased funding for kindergarten readiness and quality daycare.

My experiences as a small business owner and traditional family man have shaped my conservative ideology, however in those roles I am pragmatic in order to bring different ideologies together to resolve conflicts and get the job done. At the end of the day we are all Montanans and we want to continue to enjoy the freedoms and quality of living we deserve.","The most pressing issues for most Montanans include the rising cost of housing, economic instability, and community safety. To move forward I would propose or support legislation to put limits on the increase or decrease of property taxes, as well as exploring ways to tax property that provides an incentive to build more housing (high land tax, low house tax). I also would support legislation to lower the taxes on small local businesses. In order to grow our economy I think Montana needs to be consuming more of the product it produces, and our young adults need another option after high school in the form of trade and vocational apprenticeships. As new a father of two, I also support keeping communities safe and the ability to self defend.","I think local services are very important, but the property taxes are chasing the appraisal value and not the financial demand of those services. What would it look like if we calculated property tax in a different way, and what if we had a number to look at for government services instead of just letting them use whatever budget happens to come together? I think Montana is starting to grow exponentially as one of the last strongholds of true American values in the country, we must be careful and protect the longstanding Montana residents by being priced out by the affluent newcomers. This happens to every tourist economy. We should prioritize keeping costs low for Montana residents and increase costs for newcomers and affluent investors.","I think we should figure out what the costs of such services would be to provide care for all deserving Montanans that cannot afford private Healthcare. I wonder why these costs are never figured out first and why we pass legislation and figure out what it costs later. The way things should work is that we calculate the max revenue that can be generated through fair tax, and then allocate the funding to all programs needed for Montana to function. If the numbers aren't enough then we have to look at ways to tax. Government should be run like a business that represents the citizens, it should be invested in the best benefits for the people at the lowest cost to them and their freedoms. ","I think Montana teachers should have ratings that are based on student enjoyment, participation, and other indicators of their efficacy as an educator. Each rating should have significant pay increase as an incentive to be a super educator who is liked by students, parents, and staff. High schools and Universities should have basic and equal allocation for extra curricular activities, but extraordinary development like building a state of the art gym or art studio should come from external income like donations, ticket sales, and specific grants. Shop classes and vocational programs should be hiring out their students to local businesses to fill the labor gap and provide more income for school. It all goes back to thinking more profitably."

To that end, I would like to reform the Montana Subdivision and Platting Act and advocate for practical and effective enabling statute that will reduce time and costs for new housing development. I also see a failure of the State to provide adequate resources for mental health, and I would like to advocate for the establishment of modern mental health facilities utilizing a portion of the State's budget surplus. Health care in general needs work, and the legislature owes it to citizens to take it seriously and improve the system.","I would like to see a reassessment of the property tax structure that favors residential land owners.

However, I think value-added agricultural commodities should be treated as other commercial producers.","I believe that as a matter of public health and safety, the State should take a more active role in the provision of mental and physical health services. I would like to see funds directed to preventative care resources, and modern facilities in areas with the infrastructure to support adequate staffing dedicated to mental health care. Warm Spring's mission is admirable, but that facility alone is insufficient to deal with the issues currently facing our State.","As someone whose spouse was an educator, and left due to a lack of adequate resources, I will stand by the validity of the first part of this statement. I am skeptical of any proposal that diverts public funding to private institutions, and I want to advocate for adequate funding of PUBLIC education at all levels, including vocational re-training programs. I believe revenue that was intended to be directed to the public school system has been chipped away at over the years and the current level of funding is inadequate, as evidenced by the relatively low rate of teacher pay compared to other States. I think any proposal must consider impacts to rural schools with limited resources, and must set them up for success as well as urban centers."

","Crime and illegal drugs flowing into our state.  We need to add more law enforcement in our state, counties and cities and at the same time provide more mental health support.","I would make it more difficult for local governements to pass levies.  Possilbe a 60% majority to pass a levy.  Why should a simple majority dictate that I pay higher property taxes for something they want that I might not want.
Also, I don't believe the State should be determining what mill levies the local governments can set.
",The State of Montana needs to do more to help with the mental healthcare of it's people. I do believe much crime is the result of mental illiness and drug abuse.  As far as how that is to happen I would need more study.  ,"
Approximatly half of every homeowner's property tax bill goes to the cost of education in this state.  Raising property taxes to fund more education is not the answer.  I have to believe that the school system can do a better job with what they have.  Personally, my property taxes have doubled in the last 7 years.  I know in some Montana commuities it is much worse.  Forcing seniors out of thier homes from high property taxes is not the caring type of state I want to live in.  Education is very important in our society but I don't believe more funding is the answer.  Educators have an insatiable desire for funding and asking them to live within thier means is not unreasonable."

I have learned to understand that things can always change for the better and how to work hard to make that change happen. ","The renewal of Medicaid Expansion, due to be considered in the 2025 Legislature, is the most pressing issue facing Montana.  This should be a bipartisan issue but it initially passed by only a few votes.  We mustn't take it for granted.  Medicaid Expansion has improved the health of our community members, of our work force, and is vital to the well being of our small rural hospitals we all depend on.   A second huge priority is fixing Montana's broken mental health system.  We simply cannot do this successfully without Medicaid Expansion.  Legislation in both of these areas will be coming from Legislative Leadership and I will do everything I can to help develop it and get it passed.  ","Tax policy has been an interest of mine ever since I first ran for office eight years ago.   I have studied with experts in Montana revenue, but it is complex.   The recent bust up in property taxes could have been managed using a current mitigation process already known in the Legislature, but the Republican supermajority leadership failed to bring it forward despite prompting by the Democrat minority.   We should make that happen correctly this upcoming session.  But our entire Montana tax system needs updating and correction.  Our tax brackets are regressive.  We need to restore the top tax brackets that were changed in 2003 and repeal tax expenditures that benefit fossil fuel extraction and off shore corporations. ","In the short run we must get Medicaid Expansion passed and let's get the insulin cap passed, too.  In the long run, I believe we need to have a physical and mental health care system that is non profit and centrally managed as many other countries have successfully developed.  In the interim, we need to fund services sufficiently, consistently and expertly rather than by a haphazard  process of providing grants.  I am a strong supporter of women's rights to a full range of reproductive health services and will promote access to free birth control.   Prenatal and post partum care need to be greatly enhanced. Supporting community based systems such as Community Health Centers and state employee clinics moves us towards coordinated care. ","As recently as 2016 half our states had not returned to pre 2008 levels of funding for education following the Great Recession.  Montana's state share of higher education funding versus tuition has dropped from 76 percent in 1992 to 38 percent in 2019.  The funding recipe for public schools is an attempt to balance local and state and federal funding but it is incredibly complicated.  I don't think tinkering will fix it.  We need to modernize our tax code as noted above, get our revenue solidified and increase the overall level of funding for the entire range of education.   Funding public pre K helps educate children and let parents work so let's make that happen.   We must target more robust aid to our schools.  "

","“Permanent Property Tax Relief: Ensure fair and predictable property taxes, providing relief to homeowners and fostering economic stability. People’s financial security matters more than party politics.
Public Education: Advocate for transparent and responsible school budgeting to support every student’s success. Rework school funding formula and support educators and students.
Public Safety: Collaborate with law enforcement and community leaders to prioritize safety and build trust. Public safety unites us all, regardless of party.”","To start, Montana needs to reduce the residential property tax rate from 1.35 percent to 0.94 percent as the Department of Revenue advised in November 2021.Gianforte chose not to take the DOR’s recommendation to lower the tax rate, which all previous governors have done as that would have been the fair and prudent thing to do.
Next, Montana needs an automatic property tax “circuit breaker;” that being a tax refund for Montanans whose residential property tax costs unfairly burden their ability to pay them. This could be a calculation on the Montana income tax return.
Finally, Montana needs to go back to asking large, profitable corporations, millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes.
","We can start by not kicking 133,000 Montanans off their healthcare, 36,000 of which are children. Only 30% of them were kicked off due to income/household changes. Medicaid expansion needs to happen so we can cover the third of those Montanans that should have healthcare. 
We need to revamp the process for Medicaid application and expand the system that supports it. Long wait times, and weeks on weeks waiting for determination only to be kicked off is unacceptable. There have been federal calls for Montana to pay more attention to the medicaid process, we cannot ignore that, or the citizens it affects.
","The funding structure we currently have and the burden it places on our local communities needs to be reevaluated. Montana's current spending per student falls below the national average, while our teacher salaries rank as the lowest in the country. Investing in education not only enhances quality of life but also fosters stronger local economies, reduces crime, and boosts public safety. However, the lack of sufficient funding for education is evident. Diverting funds to private education diminishes the effectiveness of Montana's limited budget. Instead of burdening working Montanans with tax hikes, I advocate prioritizing public education by reducing tax breaks for large corporations and revising our property tax system to ensure fairness."

For housing, I support zoning reform, encouraging multi-family homes, and creative practices such as accessory dwelling units and community land trusts. Passing permanent Medicaid expansion is critical for a healthy and productive workforce. It’s also the right thing to do. The State Hospital is at serious risk of collapsing. As an attorney who has represented MSH patients, I’ll use my legal experience to draft legislation for building a new system of community-based mental health hospitals to provide patients the support they need.","The 2023 Legislature fumbled an opportunity to stop the pandemic housing spike from spiking the property taxes of everyday Montanans, many on fixed incomes. Rather than adjust property taxes to keep homeowners from getting pinched, legislators cut income taxes for the wealthiest Montanans instead. Property taxes for railroad and mine owners have a cap as to how much their property taxes can increase each year, while homeowners do not. I support a wide range of tax reforms, such as expansion of the P-TAP program to the middle class, giving local governments more levers to generate revenue, and fixing the education funding formula to reduce dependence on mill levies.","The first critical priority is to pass permanent Medicaid expansion so that thousands upon thousands of Montanans are not denied needed health care. Health care reduces homelessness and improves public safety. I’ll support any reform that brings direct care to patients. DPHHS should not be denying health care for paperwork bungles or forcing rural residents to rely on phone calls to get critical care. I will also use my mental health experience and legal background to reform Montana’s broken mental heath care system, starting with Montana State Hospital and the involuntary commitment process. We can build mental health facilities that will keep patients in the community and plugged in to local resources.",An educated community increases public safety and improves the quality of our workforce. Montana teachers are among the lowest paid in the nation. Teacher salaries must be increased. The school funding formula should be less reliant on local property taxes and mill levies. Education funding must be a reliable and consistent component of the state budget so schools know they will be getting the resources they need and can make long-term plans accordingly. I would oppose any measures that divert money from public schools. I also strongly support increased funding for early childhood education and quality daycare. Investments in early childhood education provide children with the best chance for a lifetime of success.

","
1.  The 2025 Legislature will be dealing with the political divide and incivility of political discourse. This problem cannot be addressed through legislation, but rather through the example of individual legislators, setting aside differences and looking for common ground with a willingness toward compromise.
2.	We must fully fund our public schools. We must remove the 3% cap on funding increases and have increases commensurate with the actual inflation rates.
3.	The legislature must protect our right to privacy and guard against the erosion of our personal rights, which have been under attack by our current legislature.  I will oppose any legislation that seeks to extend the hand of government into our personal lives.
","Our current property tax laws are overly complex and need reform. They currently favor big business at the expense of ordinary homeowners. I would recommend an equalization of property tax contributions between the different entities that are required to pay property tax at this time. This would prevent any entity from having to bear more than their fair share of the tax burden, which is exactly what happened in 2023 with the rising residential property taxes and the lowering of big business property taxes. The current system unfairly burdens the citizens who can least afford it. ","The Montana 2025 Legislature must vote for a permanent Medicaid expansion. Furthermore, the Medicaid enrollment process must be carefully evaluated and administrative barriers removed. We need a greater focus on meeting behavioral health needs in our rural communities and permanent funding for behavioral health specialists within our schools. ",Our public schools are the backbone of our communities and the focal point for civic engagement and unity.  Strong public schools translate to strong communities that can thrive.  Support for our public schools is of utmost importance. The current trend by our legislature to privatize education through charter schools or community choice schools is eroding that vital support.  Charter schools should be rare and need a far more rigorous approval process.  Community choice schools are unconstitutional and siphon tax dollars to pay for private education and should never be allowed.  We cannot afford to lose any of our current public school funding and need to seek other funding sources that do not require increasing local property taxes.

I have worked in the field of political science for the past 7 years as a student, researcher, and teacher. Throughout this time I identified local politics as the panacea for all political issues from political division to property tax dilemmas. I grew up in a region with extensive political turmoil which taught me how to navigate complex and divisive issues in a respectful manner that includes all.","The lack of local politics being guided by extensive levels of political polarization and nationalization of political discourse. When considering my specific district, I have seen property taxes, housing costs, crime, and a lack of access to government as the primary issues facing my population.","I have numerous ideas that I know would all provide different benefits and detriments to the population I aim to represent. I hpe that I can have extensive debates with representatives from both parties to determine which policy position we can mutually take to address this growing problem. I have identified some of these approaches to be increased taxes on short term rentals, reexamination of the marginal tax rates, implementation of a small-scale inheritance tax. These are just some of the options and I believe a long winded and detailed debate with numerous representatives would bring the best solutions.","We need to focus on improving the lives of those who are having the hardest time in society for many reasons. beyond the moral argument i want to point out the extensive financial returns that come as we help those in need. For one, every dollar we give to someone in need within our community gets spent in our community and turns into revenue for our local government. Additionally, this money gets spent at local businesses and strengthens our economy. When it comes to providing more mental health, housing and general health resources, we can see data trends indicating that increasing funding to these programs results in a decrease in crime. Helping those who are most in need helps small businesses, the local government, crime, and comfort.",We need to ensure that our public schools are operating effectively. I have a deep connecting with the education system in this county through my personal work and the work of my girlfriend who is a school teacher in the district. I want to make sure that our district is not wasting money and are putting the resources into the hands of our great teachers to enable them to work with our students comfortably and create a positive and productive work environment. I believe our local schools need and deserve more funding and we need to have the difficult discussion to figure out how to provide that.

Growing up in a small town in Iowa taught me the value of community, and how neighbors support each other while respecting each individual’s privacy and independence, as well as a life-long love of civics. Through my education in art, I learned both how to understand clearly what I observe, and how to communicate clearly through visual cues. Through my many years working as a service provider in retail and technical professions, managing teams, and leading projects, I learned how to work with many different people and still bring them together to get a job done.","I believe the most pressing issues facing Montana are those that stand in the way of our individual privacy and independence - an unfair tax burden on working Montanans, political barriers to accessing healthcare, educational censorship and micromanaging teachers, and a general disregard for a healthy, safe environment to live in. The irony is that we already have a state constitution that promises protections for privacy, a healthy environment and a fair tax system - a great deal can be accomplished if we stop writing unconstitutional laws, and stop wasting taxpayer money on defending them in court.
","While the state constitution demands that all property in the state must be equalized for tax purposes, the distribution of the property tax burden is set by the legislature through designating classes of property, tax rates, exemptions, phase-ins, and the basis of valuation. We currently have an unequal tax system where only homeowners must pay the full value of their property, while businesses and corporations enjoy exemptions and rate caps. I support fully equalizing our property tax system to give tax relief to homeowners, and reducing tax breaks from utilities and businesses who are already making excessive profits.
","After nearly two-thirds of the more than 132,000 people were disenrolled for procedural reasons or due to “failure to provide requested information.”, it’s clear that we have the opportunity to better streamline the enrollment process and make it more accessible to those who are fully qualified. Given that Medicaid reduces the health care cost burden on individuals and small businesses, keeps children healthy and enables them to access their education, and enables more people to work and support their families, all Montanans would benefit from continuing Medicaid expansion when it returns to the legislature next year in 2025.
","Montana currently spends less per student than the national average in other states, and we have the lowest teacher pay in the nation. A well-educated community improves quality of life, creates more stable and productive local economies, reduces crime and improves public safety. In this context, the lack of adequate investment in our education is showing. Splitting dollars off for individual students to pay for private education reduces the efficiency of Montana’s already tight budget. Rather than raise taxes on working Montanans, I support placing a higher budget priority on public education without diversion to private schools through reducing tax breaks for the large corporations and equalizing our property tax formula."

59 years old.  
Permanent resident of Havre, Montana.  
Executive Director of Bear Paw Development Corporation for the past 24 years.  
Bachelor's degree from the University of Montana.

I have worked in the nonprofit economic and community development sector of northern Montana's economy for nearly 30 years, the past 24 years serving five counties and two reservations in the Havre area.  

I have spent the vast majority of my career working to help communities grow and prosper.  Through financing small business start-ups and expansions, I have assisted entrepreneurs in northern Montana create jobs, expand the tax base, and make our Main Streets more vibrant.  ","I strongly support property tax reform that provides relief to residential and small business property owners.  The last legislature failed to adjust property tax rates following the most recent reappraisal cycle.  This caused undue hardship on small businesses and homeowners.  We need to fix this in the 2025 legislative session.  

In 2025, the legislature must also reauthorize Medicaid Expansion.  Failing to do so will cause countless Montanans to lose medical coverage, will forgo $900 million of federal investment into Montana's Medicaid Expansion program and will cause more than 7,500 health care workers to lose their jobs.  In rural Montana, failure to reauthorize Medicaid Expansion will very likely cause health facilities to close. ","The legislature needs to adjust property tax rates for homeowners and small businesses so the increase due to the most recent reappraisal cycle is mitigated.  

We should also look at the possibility of creating another property tax classification for non-Montanans who have second and third vacation homes in our state but currently pay the same rate as Montana families do for their family home.  

Property tax rates should be fair and not unduly burden Montana residents while allowing wealthy out of state property owners a tax haven.  ","The very first thing the Montana legislature should address with regard to health care in our state is the reauthorization of Medicaid Expansion, which is scheduled to expire in 2025.  This program provides health care for scores of lower income Montanans, most of whom are in the workforce and contributing members of society.  

This program allows rural hospitals and health clinics to stay afloat and provides jobs for more than 7,500 health care workers in Montana.  

Medicaid Expansion is also a great financial deal for the State of Montana, with the federal government picking up 80% of the cost of the program, which equates to $900 million a year into our economy.  ","The Montana legislature should invest wisely in the proper education of our children, especially since these students will become our state's future workforce.  Appropriating funds to help local school districts with the rising cost of providing a quality education to our children is an important first step to take to both bolster education at the local level and also mitigate the need for school districts to raise mill levies to fund their operation.  

I will also continue to support investing in vocational education in Montana to assure we have Montana residents who can afford to attend trade schools and vocational programs.  I had a bill to do this last session and will continue to do what is possible to enhance the trades in Montana."

In regards to my education, I doubled majored in Healthcare Administration & Sociology, graduating Magna Cum Laude. As a healthcare provider on the SDMI waiver, I understand the complexities of Medicaid & the difficulties the population I serve face on a daily basis. ","The biggest issue on my heart is that of chronic homelessness. I am running to ravamp our Medicaid system to eliminate reporting requirements by the consumer & placing in the hands of their case manager. If you are actively receiving case management, reporting your income to multiple agencies to keep your case active is a waste of tax payer monies. I would also propose building supportive living for those experiencing chronic homelessness. ","I believe Montana can do better. I would propose that we start growing industrial hemp from the east to the west and from the north to the south. Montana can quickly start producing bio fuels, food, fabrics, and so much more. We can take these Montana made products and sell them to the world, using the proceeds to eliminate the tax load on Montana residents. ","Missoula County currently has two very large populations that need support. We have a large mentally ill chronically homeless population and a population of single parents. If we provide free housing for both populations, we can train single mothers and fathers to support the chronically homeless mentally ill in a supportive housing community. This would reduce crime in Missoula and the use of our first responders significantly. This also retain healthcare workers for this population & reduce the monetary requirement for workers to just survive in Missoula County. I believe through supporting this population and producing commodities we will more than pay for this program, but will bring prosperity to Missoula and across Montana. ","The state currently receives less than $10 for the sale of 1 ounce of Medical marijuana and Montana school systems receive a very small portion of this money. The bottom line with all those receiving SSI and SSDI payments is that Montanan’s are the ones paying $200 an ounce for product & receiving a minuscule return. Removing grow regulations for providers, using Medicaid to pay for the script for cannabis at $100 per ounce, and requiring a $100 co-pay from those on Medicaid, would return $100 to the state and could significantly increase the budget for public schools.

I will introduce legislation that will fundamentally protect the right to medical privacy for women and the rights for doctors who are performing the medical procedures up until fetal viability. ","Montana currently has a $2.6 billion dollar budget surplus. In 2021, the governor and the legislature reduced the income tax rate.  In 2023, the legislature reduced the income tax rate. Manipulating the income tax rate has destabilized the property tax rate causing a significant increase.  $2.6 billion in budget surplus does not reflect a balanced budget. House Bill 212 gave additional business property tax exemptions.  Meanwhile we saw a significant increase in property taxes. Tax relief in other places was placed on the backs of property owners. Increase property tax trickles down to increased rent in areas already suffering from limited affordable housing. ","Crisis response teams embedded in City Fire and Police often serve and interact with non-resident people.  The funding for these services need to be offset with state funds, potentially from the $2.6 billion dollars in budget surplus. Funding crisis response teams enables mental health to be properly addressed at the scene and reduces the amount of times the police need to detain or hospitalize people during a mental health crisis, thereby lowering over all cost to the tax payers. ","Funding pre-k allows parents to return to the work force earlier, increasing the economic stability of the community and the household, and thereby adding to the income tax paid to the state.

Montana is my home, and I share many experiences with the constituents I represent:  I'm a parent, a renter, and a worker; I enjoy spending time in our amazing Montana wilderness and I rely on community resources like our public library and our parks and trails.  I also have two decades of experience as a community organizer.  These experiences make it possible for me to represent Missoula effectively.","Reauthorizing Medicaid expansion, creating permanent property tax relief for working Montanans, addressing funding for K-12 public education, and creating truly affordable housing will be some of the most pressing issues we will face in 2025.  Fortunately, there are good policy solutions for each.   These include:  lifting the sunset on Medicaid expansion, passing the Housing Fairness Tax Credit, changing the inflation caps on school funding, and strengthening renters' rights and emergency rental assistance programs.

I also believe that our mental health care system is at a crossroads in terms of caring for people in crisis or turning our backs on them.  These solutions will be longer-term but we nonetheless must start now.","I support passing the Montana Housing Fairness Tax Credit, a program that provides property tax relief for people based on their income.  This tax credit, similar to the existing Elderly Homeowner's Tax Credit, provides an income tax refund to individuals who pay more than a set percentage of their income in property taxes.

I believe this is a good solution because it does not change the amount of revenue collected by local governments, and also targets the tax relief to low-income Montanans who need it the most.  It avoids the pitfalls of other proposals which end up being another tax cut for the very wealthy, and also makes sure that schools, counties, and communities continue to thrive.","First and foremost, we must lift the sunset on Medicaid expansion and make that program permanent.  It has been a crucial and effective program for Montanans for a decade and we need to stop treating it as a political football.  Second, we must continue to adjust the Medicaid provider rates so that healthcare workers are paid appropriately and we can recruit and retain a robust healthcare workforce.  Lastly, we need to invest in community-based mental and behavioral health - everything from local nursing homes to substance use disorder treatment to in-patient mental health beds.  We need to stop relying on the State Hospital and our jails to provide crisis care in the state.
","I support adjusting the inflation cap on school funding (currently set at 3%) to more accurately reflect the needs of school districts and the reality of our economy.  I also support increases to the state employee pay plan to ensure that teachers at every level are competitively paid.  I oppose efforts to privatize education, especially at the K-12 levels, as this directs resources away from the education systems that serve all Montana kids."

We raised 3 children in Great Falls. I have a BS in Art Ed. and a BS in Forest Science with post-grad in Outdoor Rec. from UM & Clemson U.  As a F.S. employee, I connected with rural communities & learned first-hand how wildfire impacts private property. At the L&C Interpretive Center, I created programming & many public-private partnerships.  I led public meetings, met with the media, and kept govt. officials informed. Starting in 2010, I served as Cascade County Commissioner for 10 years, so understand local govt. I prepared county budgets & policies and much more. All of these experiences will enable me to quickly understand legislative issues.","Reauthorization of Medicaid Expansion provides healthcare for working Montanans & children; allows parents to work & provide for their families; sustains our local workforce; and supports the rural hospitals which are essential to small communities.
Residential property taxes need re-structuring so the tax burden is not unfairly borne by homeowners. Corporations & centrally assessed properties are exempt from paying their fair share & seniors are being priced out of their homes.  Also, personal property tax relief reduces taxable income essential for public education, mental health, and local government funding. 
The legislature can and must do better to fund our public education system and provide incentives to increase teacher salaries.
","Unfair tax exemptions for centrally assessed properties shifted the tax burden to Class 3 properties. Property taxes have not been equalized despite DOR advice on using a previously used multiplier for calculations. The multiplier should be applied. Another idea might be a 5-10 year phased tax increase or a % exemption for first-time homebuyers and/or senior homeowners. Centrally assessed property & large corporate exemptions should be eliminated so they pay their fair share. The Ag Exemption should also be re-visited, as some property owners in high-valued recreational areas use the Ag exemption to reduce their taxes.  The Personal Property tax rate should also be reviewed because equipment exemptions are too high. ","Re-authorization of Medicaid Expansion is essential for preventative healthcare & to keep working families healthy. To increase access to care, FQHCs or look-alikes could provide child & adult physical/dental/mental health services through our public schools. MT also desperately needs mental health crisis facilities with residential services to stabilize Montanans in crisis & move them toward full recovery. Funding should prevent crisis patients from being “warehoused” in detention facilities where they do not receive appropriate services. Montanans deserve timely assessments so they can receive mental medical services, regain their balance, return to work and provide for their families. ",Inflation impacts school budgets. Schools have difficulties attracting/retaining teachers & support staff.  The school funding formula is fundamentally sound with the exception of not having adjusted to the increasing costs the education system is facing.  The school funding formula relies heavily on the number of students. Schools with decreasing or stagnant enrollment are unable to operate without substantial operational reductions. Adjusting the formula to reduce its reliance on student numbers would be a step in the right direction. Additional state funding reducing the tax burden on property taxpayers is one adjustment consideration.  Safety & technology needs should be factored in as essential components of the formula for schools.

","The most important issues facing Montana are affordability for working and retired Montanans, passing on a stable climate system for our youth, ensuring quality public education, and maintaining an independent judiciary to safeguard our fundamental rights.  I will work with other legislators to develop solutions to these challenges facing us.","The first thing that needs to happen is for the Legislature to fulfill its constitutional obligation to equalize taxation between corporations and residential property taxes. The Legislature has failed to maintain equalization and while residential property taxes increased by $259 million last year, corporate taxes declined by $76 million.  Notably, while our homes are assessed at their full market value, corporations are allowed to negotiate their values.  We need to have tax fairness.

Second, we can institute a homestead exemption (which would be a reduction of the taxable value) for homeowners who reside fulltime in Montana and pay their income taxes in Montana and would not be available for those with second and third homes here.  
","It is vitally important that the Legislature pass Medicaid Expansion in 2025 for the sake of Montana citizens, our rural hospitals, and our economy.  If the Legislature fails to pass this, thousands of hard-working Montanans and children will go without healthcare insurance.  Our economy needs a healthy workforce, and our education system needs healthy children.  Most of our rural hospitals and clinics depend upon Medicaid to keep their doors open. Medicaid is not a hand-out; it provides affordable healthcare insurance for low income workers and their families.  80% of the cost of Medicaid comes from the federal government rather than Montana.  It is essential that we do not turn this federal money away at the expense of our citizens.","We need to: (1) Change the State Funding Formula for Public Schools to alleviate chronic budget shortfalls and not force schools to rely so heavily on local property taxes and annual school levies; (2) Recruit and Retain Quality Teachers by raising starting teacher salaries which are the lowest in the nation; (3) Special Allocation for Public School Infrastructure to maintain minimum school building standards and the necessary technology needed for a quality education.

Legislation that I would propose/support would focus on maintaining the safety, health, and quality of life for all Montana citizens regardless of gender, ethnicity or socioeconomic status.","The property tax system is complicated, will have no simple solution; however, must be addressed. The recent changes to the state tax system by the legislature during the 2023 legislative session placed the majority of the burden on the general Montana population by giving huge tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest residents and/or nonresidents. The tax burden ought to be shared equally across all property owners whether it be business, industry, or private/residential. Taxes placed on the marijuana industry could also be allocated to pay for essential services. ","Physical and mental health care services are essential to the well being of all Montanans. Over 130,00 people have lost health insurance coverage between 4/23 and 1/24. Montana currently ranks 3rd in the nation for suicide, Flathead County is 3rd in the state. All residents in Montana are impacted negatively by poor physical and mental health of its residents be that by lost job productivity or citizens’ contributions to the community. Research indicates that economic effects of expanding healthcare coverage to low income Montanans would introduce $650 million into the economy each year, support 6,000 new jobs, and add $400 million in personal income.  It is the job of the Legislature to enhance and improve access to healthcare services. ","Montana currently ranks last the country for starting teacher pay. There are currently over 1,000 job openings throughout the state in education. Public education is the ultimate equalizer in our society for individuals of any background, ethnicity, and income level to establish a path toward success and achievement in life. Funding public education is the primary job of the legislature. In order to provide quality education to our children, teachers must be paid a living wage, curriculum must be inclusive and varied, and our educational structures must be maintained appropriately. Property owners be they individuals or entities must have commiserate amounts of responsibility in funding our education system. "

Our health care system in Montana is another pressing concern for 2025. Without the renewal of Medicaid Expansion, our rural hospitals and health care system will be at risk. This decision will impact all of us. I will support the renewal of Medicaid Expansion.
Another pressing issue is public education. Our public school teachers are some of the lowest paid in the country.

I intend to listen to our folks who run hospitals and medical facilities in order to learn how the legislature can best serve them. 
Mental health is also an area to address. We have seen a rise in mental health issues among all ages since the pandemic. Instead of cutting these programs that address these needs, I will vote to fund these programs adequately.

On election day I will be 70 years old. I live in Martin City, Flathead County, Montana. My career was in the Title Insurance business as a Settlement Agent from 1972 to 2015. As C.E.O I directed all functions for the settlement of over 50,000 transactions. This required the understanding of personnel, technolegy, logistics, marketing, insurance, accounting, public relations and many other skills. While business was a focus , my (and wife Betsy) priority was raising a family of 4 children. These life experiences helped me evolve to the person that I am today and I am confident that I can be an effective legislator.",Due to my experience in the Real Estate field I feel I can be most effective in the area of Affordable Housing. Tax revenue can be used to subsidize down payments for qualified home owners. Climate change can be addressed by enacting laws to reduce the effects of the use of fossil fuels. Individual freedoms should include gender rights. ,I support the introduction of sales tax so that revenue from visitors would be used to support our local essential services. ,A medical need can never be a deferred expense. We need  to enact legislation and allocate funds to support citizens ability accessing care. ,"We need to trust the experts, namely teachers and administrators to lead and advise on the needs and priorities of our Montana students. Schools have expanded services for students greatly in the last 30 years. Funding needs to keep up with this need. More allocation in funding for education needs to be a priority in budget discussions. "

I live in Lockwood, MT and am a self-employed General Contractor, developer and business owner.  I have a BS in Computer Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration.  I have been blessed to be born and raised in Montana.  We have a special place in this world, and I appreciate all it has to offer.  Growing up, being educated, working and building a business in Montana gives me a great perspective of the true needs, beliefs, and values that Montanans have and appreciate.","The most pressing issue facing us as a society is our financial well-being.  Inflation is hurting everyone and is caused primarily by our out-of-control federal government spending.  There are many important issues, but if we as individuals, and us as a state and country can’t pay our bills, the rest of the issues don’t rise above that on the priority level.  Having said that, I am for tax reduction and reducing the size of the government.  This is a freedom issue, because the more money and power we give to our government, the more freedoms we are sacrificing as citizens.  Finally, we must work to ensure our safety through stringent enforcement of laws, particularly those that address substance use and its impact on crime in our community.","An issue as complicated as this will not be easily resolved.  The fact is that the state portion of our property taxes is a small percentage of our overall tax bill, while the majority are local taxes.  The state portion of our property taxes is used to pay for schools.  I would not support taking that money away from the schools.  Local citizens have more control of the local property taxes, as many of those are voted on levies.  The system already set by legislature is working, but the citizens have to be open to alternative ideas to tax revenue to reduce their income and property tax burden.  As legislators, being open and honest with the citizens is the best way to communicate the ideas that may come forward. ","The Legislature has taken steps and should continue to take steps to encourage mental and physical health care providers to practice in Montana, especially rural Montana.  In addition, the new medical schools in Montana are providing opportunities for home grown physicians to stay and practice in Montana, and we need to encourage more of this.","Montana’s school funding formula is unnecessarily complicated and difficult to understand.  The entire school funding formula should be simplified to ensure that taxes are allocated in the appropriate manner to uphold Montana’s constitutional mandate “to provide a basic system of free quality public elementary and secondary schools.”  The Montana Constitution further states “The legislature may provide such other educational institutions, public libraries, and educational programs as it deems desirable.”   I am a big supporter of Career and Technical Education programs that need to be encouraged and financially supported by both the state and private industry."
